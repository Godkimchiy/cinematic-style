  "overview": "Are videogames art? Do they influence violent behavior? What effect have they had on society? How would you describe videogames to Leonardo da Vinci? These are always great questions to start a conversation.  Pixel Poetry is a documentary film about progressive creative culture as it has been championed by one of its greatest advocates - videogames. Using popular debates that have long surrounded videogames as a catalyst for this, the film will analyze the misunderstood notions and arguments in art and technological advancement to bring a new perspective to a compelling discussion about the evolution of its meaning.",
  "storyline": "A film that uses videogames as a catalyst for the transcendence of art through technology, and the worldwide creative culture they have influenced in their growth in the modern day. Through the words of many respected gaming personalities, as discussion is made about how videogames have come into their own as an expressive medium, and how they have made us question and think about their characters, worlds, and much much more.",
