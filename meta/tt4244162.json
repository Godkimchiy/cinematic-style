(January 2015)\nBeta Test revolves around a Seattle-based video game tester, Max Troy (Larenz Tate), who is tasked with reviewing the latest sensation from global video game juggernaut, Sentinel, prior to the game's release. As he begins his procedural dissection of the game, he begins to realize this new game is not like any other. As new missions are completed, the same events happening in the game occur within the real world. Soon, a deep-rooted conspiracy is uncovered from within the walls of Sentinel, which is lead to showcase that the game's protagonist, Orson Creed (Manu Bennett), is a real man, in the real world. If Creed can join forces with the man controlling him, together they may have a chance at unraveling and possibly stopping this conspiracy before the tasks in the game escalate and overwhelm their city. This film was produced from 2010 to 2016.",
