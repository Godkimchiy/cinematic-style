  "overview": "Michel, a fifty year old man, graphic designer, decides to change the urban lifestyle and go on an adventure. Fascinated by airmail, he dreams at Jean Mermoz when he's on scooter. One day, Michel sees a picture of a kayak.",
  "storyline": "Middle-aged graphic design company manager Michel loves planes. Day and night - in the shower, at work, riding his scooter - he dreams of life as an airborne explorer. Then one day a photograph stops him dead in his tracks. Kayaks - they could almost be planes, planes without wings. Seized by a sudden crazy impulse, Michel orders the whole package online: canoe, paddles - everything he needs for an expedition. His wife Rachelle encourages him to set out alone on his escapade. So what if he's never rowed a boat in his life? Adventure is adventure. His big trip on the water turns out to be full of surprises and unexpected encounters: Laetitia, the owner of a riverside bar, her crazy employees, the young waitress Mila - after a night in their company, Michel finds it very hard to leave.",
