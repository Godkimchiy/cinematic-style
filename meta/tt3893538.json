  "overview": "Sonic Highways commemorates the Foo Fighters' 20th anniversary by documenting the eight-city recording odyssey that produced their eighth studio album.  This film includes the 8 episode series, extended interviews and never before seen footage, inside the recording of Sonic Highways.",
  "storyline": "To salute the band's 20th year and inspire its eighth studio album, Foo Fighters' founder/frontman Dave Grohl has produced \"a love letter to the history of American music.\" His documentary taps into the styles and heritage of Austin, Chicago, Los Angeles, Nashville, New Orleans, New York, Seattle and Washington, D.C. Each hourlong episode has Grohl and bandmates Taylor Hawkins, Nate Mendel, Chris Shiflett and Pat Smear recording a song in each city. Locals Buddy Guy, Joe Walsh, Dolly Parton, Rick Nielsen, Chuck D, Allen Toussaint, Gary Clark Jr. and others, contribute to tracks, illustrating how one's surroundings affect tonal/rhythmic traits and how music legends impact their hometowns.",
