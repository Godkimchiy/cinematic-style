  "overview": "Three loosely connected stories: The relationship between midwife Rosa and therapist Marcel is shaken to the core by a cancer diagnosis. Wandering aimlessly through life, waitress Motte is horrified to discover she\u2019s pregnant \u2013 by her best friend Neo, who\u2019s not even sure about his sexual orientation. Finally, cleaning lady Layla refuses to accept that her ex, Navid, has left her for a younger woman. Each situation escalates on one fateful night: A gun is fired, a woman dies, and a child is born. \u2018Without you\u2019 \u2013 an expression that can be formulated both negatively and positively: \u2018I can\u2019t live without you\u2019 also means \u2018life is much better with you\u2019. Director Alexandre Powelz maximises this interpretation to its fullest potential. OHNE DICH is a film both about love and its bitter ingredients, and the equally sobering, yet comforting certainty that life goes on.",
  "storyline": "Without you I will be better off, Motte, a pregnant young woman thinks about her unborn child. Without you I cannot imagine living at all, Marcel tells his fatally ill wife Rosa. Without you I will not continue, Layla making it drastically clear to her ex-lover. Without you is a film about the most beautiful and painful thing in life: love.",
