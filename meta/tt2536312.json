  "overview": "Through the recovery of found Super-8mm footage captured by his brother during the 70\u00b4s dictatorship, Andr\u00e9 tries to revive the memories of his father, who\u2019s been waiting for his missing son for over 30 years.",
  "storyline": "After separating from his wife, Andr\u00e9 goes back to live with his father. The reunion reveals a difficult and distant relationship, due to the disappearance of the other son thirty years ago during the Brazilian military dictatorship. The father lives a life of reclusion and longing, emotionally tied to his dog. He spends his days playing with a dog who is more interested in what is happening outside than his master. Hoping to get closer to his father, Andr\u00e9 brings up some old Super-8mm film rolls, shot by his brother before his disappearance. These old images appear repeatedly in AVANTI POPOLO, sharing with the spectator the history of the family and the brother, physically absent but present throughout the film.",
