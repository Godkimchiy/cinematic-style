  "overview": "Meenakshi, a Marathi gal with an ultra-sensitive sense of smell, lives her life in her dreams, dancing and enacting her favourite actresses Sridevi, Madhuri and Juhi. Not believing in arranged marriages, Meenakshi awaits her prince when she comes across Tamil artist Surya, to whom she is strangely attracted to.",
  "storyline": "Wildly imaginative and film-obsessed, Meenakshi Deshpande has an extra sensitive nose. After she is hired to work in a local college's library, she catches a wonderful scent in the air. The source is Surya, a handsome and enigmatic art student from a Tamil family. Meanwhile, Meenakshi's eccentric Marathi family has arranged for her marriage to Madhav, a kind and sensible man. Meenakshi is torn between marrying her parents' choice for a seemingly ideal husband, or following her nose and chasing the hunky stranger who may or may not be all that he seems.",
  "plot": "The story is about a Marathi girl Meenakshi (Rani Mukerji) falling in love with a Tamil artist Surya (Prithviraj Sukumaran). She is a librarian at a college. She has five members in her family(including herself): A wheelchair ridden grandmother (Jyoti Subhash) who is blind and has gold teeth, her father who smokes four cigarettes together, her mother (Nirmiti Sawant) who is obsessed with marriage, and her brother Nana (Amey Wagh) whose only love in life is dogs. To add to her miseries the government garbage bin is placed right in front of her home. To escape the craziness of her family, Meenakshi lives her life in dreams, and in her dreams the only thing she's doing is dancing and enacting her favourite actresses: Madhuri, Sridevi, Juhi etc. Then there is Maina or \"Gaga Bai\"(Anita Date), her colleague, an eccentric woman who dresses up in weird ensembles inspired by pop star Lady Gaga. Meenakshi's family is looking for a suitable groom but Meenakshi, who doesn't believe in arranged marriages, is waiting for her prince and wants her dream wedding. That's when Surya (Prithviraj) enters. Surya is an art student, and the moment Meenakshi looks at him she falls in love with his tanned skin and a mysterious fragrance emanating from him. By this time her family has found the 'right guy' Maadhav (Subodh Bhave) for her, and are rushing with her wedding. The rest of the film involves Madhav running around after Meenakshi, and Meenakshi following Surya.Nana gets engaged to Maina under bizarre circumstances when Meenakshi goes missing on her engagement date when she actually was following Surya and ends up in his incense sticks factory. Meenakshi learns that Surya's fragrance, that she got enthralled to, was actually because of his involvement in the factory. In the end, Meenakshi eventually succeeds in winning over Surya's heart and they get engaged in a traditional Maharashtrian ceremony.",
