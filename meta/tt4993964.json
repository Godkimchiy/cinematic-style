  "storyline": "A family together with their grandpa go on a vacation, when their new car won't stop and it nearly escapes crashing into a hundred cars.",
  "plot": "Ang\u00e9lique (Audrey Tautou) purchases a single pink rose at a flower shop to be delivered to her lover, Dr. Lo\u00efc Le Garrec (Samuel Le Bihan). Ang\u00e9lique is a successful art student. In between creating her art projects, she works part-time at a cafe and house sits for a wealthy vacationing family. Ang\u00e9lique's friend David (Cl\u00e9ment Sibony) disapproves of Ang\u00e9lique's affair with Lo\u00efc, who is married, but Ang\u00e9lique insists that Lo\u00efc will leave his wife for her.\n\nWhen Lo\u00efc's wife, Rachel (Isabelle Carr\u00e9), has a miscarriage, the pair separate and Ang\u00e9lique prepares to leave with Lo\u00efc on a romantic getaway to Florence, Italy. However, Lo\u00efc doesn't meet Ang\u00e9lique at the airport, having chosen to mend things with his wife. This throws Ang\u00e9lique into a self-destructive cycle of clinical depression, losing her job and scholarship. While watching the news one night, she learns that Lo\u00efc has been arrested for assaulting one of his patients, Sonia Jasmin (Nathalie Krebs). She goes to Sonia's house to convince her to drop the charges, and in the ensuing scuffle, Sonia has a heart attack and dies. Ang\u00e9lique steals from the house to make it look like a robbery. Ang\u00e9lique thinks this will win Lo\u00efc back, but instead he's arrested for Sonia's murder, and embraces his wife as he is dragged away. Ang\u00e9lique returns home, turns on the gas and lies down on the floor.\n\nAt this point the film rewinds to the opening scene when Ang\u00e9lique bought the pink rose. This time the film follows the delivery boy and the subsequent events play out from Lo\u00efc's viewpoint.\n\nLo\u00efc receives the pink rose and assumes that his wife sent it to him. It is revealed that Lo\u00efc barely knows Ang\u00e9lique, and they cross paths only because Ang\u00e9lique is house sitting Lo\u00efc and Rachel's neighbor's house. Lo\u00efc receives Ang\u00e9lique's gifts and messages, but doesn't know who sent them. It is revealed that Rachel's miscarriage was caused by \"someone\" running her down with a moped; earlier in the film, Ang\u00e9lique is shown after an \"accident\" which ruined her friend's moped and injured her arm. Lo\u00efc comes to believe that his stalker is Sonia; he physically attacks her and she presses charges for assault. After she dies of a heart attack, Lo\u00efc is arrested as the prime suspect for her murder. At his arrest, Rachel tells the police that he was with her on the night of the death, which clears him of all charges.\n\nThat night, Lo\u00efc sees an ambulance pull up to his neighbor's house. Ang\u00e9lique has just tried to commit suicide, and as a doctor, Lo\u00efc performs mouth-to-mouth resuscitation which causes her to regain consciousness. Now aware of Ang\u00e9lique, he considers the possibility that she is his stalker. Lo\u00efc explores the house that Ang\u00e9lique was house-sitting, and finds a life-sized garbage mosaic of himself. Ang\u00e9lique and Lo\u00efc have a final confrontation, where he declares that they never had nor will ever have a relationship, and Ang\u00e9lique strikes him over the head with a brass figurine. She is arrested, diagnosed with erotomania and remanded to a mental institution. Rachel stands by her husband while he recovers from his injuries, with a scene showing the couple in a house filled with their children as Lo\u00efc hobbles around on a cane.\n\nFive years later, Ang\u00e9lique is released from the mental institution. Her therapist praises her progress and tells her, \"If you keep taking your medication, you will be fine.\" However, when the cleaning man is clearing Ang\u00e9lique's room, he discovers her pills have been glued to the wall behind the wardrobe in a mosaic of Lo\u00efc, thus showing that Ang\u00e9lique has never taken her medication. The film then ends with a quotation from a real erotomaniac, \"Though my love is insane, my reason relieves the pain of the heart, telling me to be patient and not lose hope,\" displayed on the screen.",
