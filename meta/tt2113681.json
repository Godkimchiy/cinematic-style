  "overview": "After living a long and colorful life, Allan Karlsson finds himself stuck in a nursing home. On his 100th birthday, he leaps out a window and begins an unexpected journey.",
  "storyline": "Based on the internationally best-selling novel by Jonas Jonasson, the unlikely story of a 100-year-old man who decides it's not too late to start over. For most people it would be the adventure of a lifetime, but Allan Karlsson's unexpected journey is not his first. For a century he's made the world uncertain, and now he is on the loose again.",
  "plot": "Allan Karlsson is about to celebrate his hundredth birthday, and a party is planned at his retirement home. Allan is alert despite his age, but is not interested in attending the party. Instead he climbs out the window and disappears. He walks in his slippers to the nearest bus station, intending to travel as far as his available cash will allow. While at the bus station, an angry young man with a suitcase too big to fit it and himself inside the toilet he desperately needed to give it to Allan and tells him to hold it for him and wait. Within half a minute Allan's bus arrives and Allan takes the suitcase with him to the bus and boards. The young angry man misses the bus. The suitcase turns out to be stuffed with drug money, and Karlsson is chased by drug dealers trying recover their lost money. The retirement home calls the police to look for Allan. The police have no knowledge of the money and are only looking for Allan who is somewhat absent minded. Allan is simply trying to escape his retirement home confinement and gets caught up in criminal activity by accident so he ends up, unknowingly, being hunted by the police and murderous criminals.\n\nThe novel intercuts Karlsson's adventures as a centenarian with increasingly fantastic past episodes from his long life. As the novel proceeds it transpires that Karlsson had helped to make the atom bomb, became good friends with Harry S. Truman and General Franco, knew Stalin, Kim Jong-il, Mao Tse-tung, and Soong Mei-ling, foiled an assassination plot against Winston Churchill, and was a participant behind the scenes in many of the key events of the twentieth century.",
