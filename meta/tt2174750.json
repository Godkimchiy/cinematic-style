  "overview": "It takes two or three generations for the monarch butterfly to reach the Canadian breeding grounds, but it is one \"supergeneration\" that makes the 2,000 mile return trip back south into central Mexico. The documentary film covers Dr Fred Urquhart's interest in monarch butterflies, with perspectives of Urquhart as a child wondering where the butterflies went, his years of research and study into their life and migration, to his time decades-later as a senior scientist looking back at his investigations and discoveries about the insect's life pattern.",
  "storyline": "It is a natural history epic. It is a detective story. Join hundreds of millions of real butterflies on an amazing journey to a remote and secret hideaway, and one scientist's 40-year search to unravel the mystery - where do they go each fall? Experience the Flight of the Butterflies.",
