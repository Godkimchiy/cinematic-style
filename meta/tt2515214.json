  "overview": "Just by watching Lupe stuck at home in her robe and slippers, no one would will guess that in the 80's she was a rock star. Gone are the times of concerts, fame and success. Agoraphobia does not let her leave home. She depends entirely on Paquita, his mother, a superstitious Mexican, with a huge heart, which not only takes care of his daughter but also her teenage grandson. The problem is that Paquita is running out of time and she doesn't  want to leave without getting her daughter back.",
  "storyline": "If you saw Lupe (35) in her bathrobe and slippers, stuck at home making pies, you would never imagine that back in the 80's she was a pop-rock star. She and her brother Diego made up the band Groenlandia, whose first album was a huge hit. But Lupe has turned her back on that distant past of touring and concerts. She lives wholly dependent on her mother Paquita (65) and has a teenage son, Pancho(14), who hates her. Her agoraphobia won't even let her leave the house to buy the ingredients she needs for cooking. Luckily her mother, Paquita, a superstitious Mexican woman with a heart of gold,is there to do the shopping, deal with her frequent crises and do what matters most: be a mother to Pancho. But Paquita is running out of time. She just found out that she's going to die and she has only one final goal: to prepare her family for life without her.",
