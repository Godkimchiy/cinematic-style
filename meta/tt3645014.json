  "overview": "This is a dramatic chain of events in the most glamorous ,swinging era of Hindi films... the 1960s. It was a decade when film stars tasted success and carried their larger than life screen image on to real life with unbridled pomp and splendour. It was during this time that two ambitious films were made... Ujwal Nirmal Sheetal and Reena Mera Naam. The latter became a runaway hit while the former was struggling at the box office.",

  "synopsis": "Apart from the main story that unfolds, and that concerns four actors - Ravi Kumar, Chandni, Zara Fernandes and Virman Shah, the story has 2 directors, each trying to make their own movie a box-office hit, a music director with an older-age wife, a care-taker woman, and a police inspector whose revelations are quite important at the end. The movie is set in the 1960s.The apparent suicide by Zara Fernandes turns out to be a homicide, and the suspects include all the main players in the game. An astute ex-policeman Ravi Kumar ultimately unravels the threads of different sub-plots and leads the viewer to a sensible ending.Anant Mahadevan as the director of Ujwal, Nirmal, Sheetal promotes Ravi Kumar, Virman Shah and Zara Fernandes together in a path-breaking movie, but his movie's hopes are sabotaged by another director, Rajan Anna, who is simultaneously making Reena Mera Naam with Chandni in the lead role. Zara does manage to bag a Filmfare award for her role; at the post-awards party, a series of events leads to the death of Zara as she falls from a balcony high-up in the building. Treated at first as a sad suicide, the truth emerges later when it becomes apparent to the investigating police that this was a homicide. The needle of suspicion falls on the music director Kenny Damania (or KD), but the actual act of murder was an act of someone else. If I reveal the entire plot, there won't be any need to see the movie."
