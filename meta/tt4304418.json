  "storyline": "Julian (played by Derek Ramsay) is on the look out for a translator who knows how to translate English to Filipino to teach him the language for certain reasons. After several interviews, he hired Tere (played by Jennylyn Mercado) to teach him Filipino. Along the way, Tere and Julian become friends who tell each other's love relationship, which in turn are very unfortunate. Towards the end, Tere falls for Julian, but it seems like Julian is back with his ex-girlfriend (played by Isabel Oli) - the very reason why he hired a Tere.",
