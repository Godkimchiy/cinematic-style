  "overview": "Directed by Ian Gabriel, \u201cFour Corners\u201d revolves around a 13-year-old chess whiz drawn into the Cape Town\u2019s well-known child-gang culture. Touted as the first film to delve into the 100-year-old war between South Africa\u2019s so-called Number gangs, the 26 and the 28, it blends the Sabela, Tsotsi-taal and Cape Afrikaans dialects and mixes established talents with non-actors and first-time thesps from schools and communities across the Cape Flats.",
  "storyline": "Fatherless and raised by his grandmother, thirteen year old Ricardo Galam lives in South Africa's Cape Flats, a unique and volatile sub culture dominated by two Number gangs, the 26 and 28. Ricardo's future as a chess prodigy is threatened by his growing interest in the 26 whose local leader is grooming him as a potential member. Unknown to Ricardo, the father he's never known has been released from prison. Farakhan, a reformed general in the 28, is back in his old neighbourhood, an intruder in 26 territory. In a story that is at times raw and violent at other times touching and true. FOUR CORNERS is a gripping drama set against the backdrop of a gang war in Cape Town which has been raging for a 100 years; a little known fact.",
