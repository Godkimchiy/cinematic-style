Believing he's finally discovered the ideal subject for his next documentary, Damon gets caught up in a conspiracy that threatens him and the ones he loves. Chasing shady leads, and armed only with his camera, Damon must overcome his fears about the future and prepare himself to make the ultimate sacrifice. By depicting cataclysmic events through the perspective of one individual, writer/director Grigorij Richters succeeds in crafting a truly human story about love, disillusionment and obsession in the face of overwhelming cosmic forces.",

However, a glimmer of hope remains in the form of a secret space station orbiting the Earth that can house up to 2,000 people. In exchange for a ticket to this space station, they task Damon with documenting the final moments leading up to the asteroid strike.\n\nSeeing an opportunity to save Ann and his unborn child, a chance to mend the rift his obsession has created, Damon accepts the assignment. As the end of days arrives, Damon watches London descend into madness, with families torn apart and friends lost.
