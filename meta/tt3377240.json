  "storyline": "TEXAS REIN is an all-American story that explores the family dynamic when a prodigal daughter returns home. CASSIE ROBERTS, an ex-rodeo queen turned single mom, has been running from her past and a long trail of bad decisions until she gets an urgent call to return home for her ailing father, MARVIN. Cassie plans to stay only long enough to help her father get back on his feet. But when she sees SPLASH, her father's prize winning Quarter Horse, her plans change. Cassie wants to see Splash compete in the International Equestrian Games and she wants the best trainer in east Texas to make it happen. But when Cassie meets CHASE EVERSOLL, a handsome \"cowboy\" horse trainer, she gets more than she bargained for. As their work turns personal, Chase challenges Cassie to let go of her past and reminds her that reconciliation begins with forgiveness. Texas Rein celebrates the gift of family and the hope of second chances.",
