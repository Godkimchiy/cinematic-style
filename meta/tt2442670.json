  "overview": "Inspired by real events, The Last Executioner is the story of Chavoret Jaruboon, the last person in Thailand whose job it was to execute by gun. A rock musician who adored Elvis, but took a 'respectable' job to support the family he loved devotedly, and then constantly tried to reconcile the good and bad karma that came from this decision.",
  "storyline": "Inspired by real events, THE LAST EXECUTIONER is the incredible true story of Chavoret Jaruboon, the last person in Thailand whose job it was to execute by gun - a wild rock and roller who took a 'respectable' job to support the family he loved devotedly, then constantly tried to reconcile the good and bad karma that came from his decision. It is a story of life at its most beautiful and death at its most surreal.",
  "plot": "An executioner and his family try to survive from the dead.",
  "synopsis": "The life of a rock-and-roller-turned-executioner would be a good story for any filmmaker to transform into a film, but is even more fascinating due to the fact that he was the last executioner in the land of Buddhism. Thai-English director Tom Waller has crafted this plot of duality into a bag of cinematic conflicts in his latest pic THE LAST EXECUTIONER. Reality and subconscious, presence and flashback, foreign and Thai imaginations mutually encounter one another in this hybrid biopic.Chavoret Jaruboon enjoys his fun-filled youth life. He loves Elvis Presley and rock-and-roll, and can even earn some pennies by entertaining G.I.s. If only his girlfriend wasn't pregnant, and Chavoret might not need to find a secure job to support his family. He ends up becoming the state's executioner. The fingers that previously strummed guitar strings are now used to pull a trigger instead. In his ensuing 19 years of mortal relations, fifty-five lives are ended with over 500 bullets. What happens beyond the executions is framed by the man's encounter with his guilt and his attempts at karmic reconcilement. Ultimately, THE LAST EXECUTIONER dramatises everyone's self-questioning in the face of death and life. Jaruboon's world of morbidity is illustrated both realistically and through his subconscious. From the very first scene, his walk through life is accompanied and challenged by the god of death who mocks him and chases him like a partner in the game of life and death. Actor David Asavanond (COUNTDOWN) seems to be born for this kind of nagging role as the representative of Jaruboon's destiny. He convinces us that we all share the same fate: we are all destined to be executed either by the laws of world or society. Waller reaches this paradox by breaking the narrative into three parts: the boy Jaruboon, whose rock-and-roll dreams are shadowed by a fortune-teller's premonition of death; the young Jaruboon as a rock star and executioner; and the aged Jaruboon's encounter with his own karma. These parts are weaved into a single narrative, underpinned by masterly cinematography and art direction. Most impressive of all is his superb portrayal of Thai beliefs about the afterlife and superstition - the connections between amulets and death, merit and karma, this life and the next, and the transfer of karma to one's family. The system of justice is also questioned by the director in relation to the execution of the female inmate Duangjai, who was believed to be innocent. In these ways THE LAST EXECUTIONER encourages us to rethink the system of Thai justice and Buddhist beliefs."
