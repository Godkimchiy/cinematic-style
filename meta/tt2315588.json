  "overview": "Girlfriend in a Coma is a documentary that exposes the dire situation of Italian politics and the process of economic and social decline the country has suffered during the last two decades, treating the decline as a warning of what might happen elsewhere in the West. The decline has occurred amid a collapse of moral values and the victory of \u201cMala Italia\u201d over \u201cBuona Italia\u201d. It has been lauded as being ground-breaking in its creative combination of animation, interviews and hard facts, and has caused fierce controversy in Italy.",
  "storyline": "Renowned British journalist examines Italy's moral, political and economic crisis, looking for clues to its possible salvation--and that of the West as a whole.",
  "plot": "The documentary, using the eyes of an English outsider directed by a passionate, but exiled, Italian insider, exposes the dire situation of Italian politics and the process of economic and social decline the country has suffered during the last two decades, treating the decline as a warning of what might happen elsewhere in the West. The decline has occurred amid a collapse of moral values and the victory of \"Mala Italia\" over \"Buona Italia\". Critical of Silvio Berlusconi, the former Prime Minister, for some of the actions his government undertook or failed to undertake, and for his inappropriate use of his media companies to influence the Italian electorate, the documentary also does not spare criticism of the Left.\n\nOverall, the film identifies \"ignavia\", the sin of lack of moral courage denounced by Dante Alighieri in his Divine Comedy (1321), as one of the crucial issues behind Italians\u2019 failure to act when faced with their country\u2019s constant decline over the past 20 years.\nFeatures\n\nThe documentary features interviews with Mario Monti, Prime Minister of Italy in 2011\u201312, Elsa Fornero, a member of his Cabinet, Umberto Eco, philosopher and novelist, Nanni Moretti, movie director, Lorella Zanardo, activist and filmmaker, Toni Servillo, one of today\u2019s top Italian actors, John Elkann, Chairman of FIAT, Sergio Marchionne, CEO of FIAT, Carlo Petrini, founder of Slow Food, Roberto Saviano, the author of Gomorrah, Giovanni Ferrero, CEO of Ferrero, Emma Bonino, former European Commissioner and Italian foreign minister in 2013, Susanna Camusso, trade union leader, Nicola Gratteri, anti-mafia magistrate, but also many unsung heroes from civil society such as Don Giacomo Panizza, a priest who founded the \"Progetto Sud\" against organised crime in Calabria.",
