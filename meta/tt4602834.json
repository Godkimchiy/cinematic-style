  "storyline": "The Surire Salt Flat is placed at an altitude of 4300 m in the Chilean High Plateau and one of the very last places in the world, keeping the treasure of untouched nature with all its beauty, but also holds an allurement: a huge amount of borax, promising the mining industry profits in unknown levels. SURIRE, directed by two extraordinary filmmakers, tells us in an outstanding visual way metaphorically the story of our planet - about the very important subject of disappearance of traditional indigenous culture, untouched nature, environment, clash of the new and old.",
