  "overview": "\u201cGetting Up\u201d is a film about legendary L.A. graffiti artist Tony \u201cTempt\u201d Quan who was diagnosed with ALS and became almost completely paralyzed. Through the use of some amazing technology Tony is able to continue making art with the movement of his eyes.",
  "storyline": "Getting Up is a documentary about the life of artist, TEMPT. It asks the question, 'How does a fallen man get back up?' Tony 'TEMPT' Quan is a legendary LA graffiti artist, social activist and publisher. In 2003, TEMPT was diagnosed with ALS. Except for the use of his eyes, he is now unable to move, breathe or speak... but his mind and creative spirit are intact. Mick Ebeling founded the Not Impossible Foundation in order to give a voice back to TEMPT, and in 2009 an open-source DIY device called 'The Eyewriter' was created that allowed TEMPT to once again do his art. Getting Up beautifully illustrates that through the will of two men, and on the shoulders of a community, anything is possible.",
