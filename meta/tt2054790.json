  "storyline": "In the 16th century in the C\u00e9vennes, a horse dealer by the name of Michael Kohlhaas leads a happy family life. When a lord treats him unjustly, he raises an army and puts the country to fire and sword in order to have his rights restored.",
  "plot": "During the 16th century, horse dealer Michael Kohlhaas is taking his horses to market. As he passes through a local baron's lands, the baron seizes two of his horses, even though the right to extract tolls has been abolished in the country. When Kohlhaas discovers that his loyal servant was attacked by the baron's guard dogs, and that his horses have been injured and abused, he attempts to sue for monetary compensation, but his lawsuit is dismissed because the baron has a kinsman at court. Later, Kohlhaas's wife dies from injuries suffered at the hands of the baron's men.\n\nKohlhaas leads a revolt to attack the Baron's house and then to induce the authorities to administer satisfactory justice.",
