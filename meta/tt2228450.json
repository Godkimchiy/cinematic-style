  "overview": "A young girl tries to prove that the mysterious old lady next door is really an angel, when some of the neighborhood kids\u2019 Christmas wishes. Olivia is not like most fifth graders. She is being raised by Melinda, a single mother who works at a bustling local bakery run by her good friend Daphne, the mother of Olivia's best friend and classmate. Olivia has a heart of gold that shines through in her good intentions and her imagination. During the hustle and bustle of the Christmas season, a mysterious lady quietly moves into the house next door. The house has been uninhabited since the owner, Dr. Nathan Davis, left town abruptly. When some of the neighborhood kids Christmas wishes suddenly begin to come true, Olivia is convinced that the towns newcomer is an angel and she is determined to prove it.",
  "storyline": "From grade school class oral reports on one's most improbable Christmas wish, student Olivia begins to notice a few coming true. She and friend Lucas believe it's the long-abandoned house next door to her that grants the wishes (if made while throwing a rock at it). Olivia soon meets a reclusive old woman living inside and, together, they begin reviewing the wishes left at the gate (in a wish box built in front to stop folks from damaging the property). As Olivia wishes a new husband for her single mom, the landlord of the abandoned house (a doctor) comes into their lives, but Olivia would rather her mom had the peppy new substitute teacher. Some things must be left in God's hands.",
