  "synopsis": "The movie, as the original title suggests, is about 17th century seafarer Michiel de Ruyter, a central figure in the newly founded Dutch Republic's fight against Great Britain. Although the French were also part of Britains's alliance, Germany however was NOT - first of all because Germany didn't even exist yet (founded in 1848!), so the existing description is quite faulty on that part, though it is true that the diocese of M\u00fcnster which is part of modern day Germany was also an ally of the British which made minor contributions to the English effort (but certainly not sending a fleet of their own since it was and is a landlocked place which back in the period in question shared a common border with the Netherlands which is why they are referred to as the Duitsers - Dutch for Germans - in the course of the movie)\nThe story opens with one of the last sea battles of the First Dutch-English Naval War (1652-1654) and follows de Ruyter through the further course of his personal as well as Dutch history in the struggle of maintaining independence while at the same time trying to prevent the Republic from turning back into a Monarchy and establishing an empire of overseas colonies and trade routes.\nAfter the end of the first Naval War we see de Ruyter in charge of upgrading the Dutch Navy, i.e. helping build new and better ships and weaponry, and also modernising it by way of new tactics and a superior system of communication (signalling) which was developed by the brother of reigning prime minister de Witt.\nAfter a sequence of shipbuilding and training the story shifts to the second naval war with England, depicting the outnumbered Dutch taking on a more sizeable British fleet in an epic battle, testing their new communications and tactics rather successfully."
