The disturbed street artist Victor that is The Cross Killer discloses to a victim that when he was twelve years old, in his hometown San Jose del Monte, his pious mother caught him masturbating and delivered him to the Priest Jose. The pedophile priest raped him, showing the darkness with the successive abuses and Victor has been listening to demons since then.
