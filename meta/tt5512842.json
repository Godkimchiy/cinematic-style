  "overview": "Wednesday afternoon was deliberately chosen. There were a lot of customers in front of and in the brothers \u00d6zcan and Hasan Yildirim\u2019s barbershop on 9 June 2004, when 700 three-inch carpenters\u2019 nails turned into projectiles with a 250 metre range. 22 people were injured. The attack was infamous; the course of the investigations was equally scandalous: the victims were suspected. CCTV material was not analysed and Federal Minister of the Interior Otto Schily decisively ruled out a right wing background. It was only in 2001 that this crime was solved in the course of the revelations concerning the right wing extremist terrorist \u201cNational Socialist Underground\u201d group. The trial continues until the present day.",
