  "overview": "The 2011 New Year celebration at the Ratchaprasong Junction in Bangkok. This is where demonstrators\u2019 protests were violently crushed a few months earlier, with more than 100 people ending up dead. It was there that the conflict between the largely rural \"red shirts\" and the more affluent, royalist \"yellow shirts\" escalated. How did this come to pass? Filmmaker Nontawat Numbenchapol came across young soldier Aod by chance, who had just completed his military service, and asked if he could accompany the soldier on his way home. Aod\u2019s village is on the border to Cambodia and near the Hindu temple of Prasat Preah Vihea, which both countries claim as their own. Here too, a violent conflict is smouldering.",

  "plot": "One day, high school student Akihito Kanbara instinctively goes to save his fellow schoolmate, Mirai Kuriyama, from committing suicide. Following his pleas, Mirai suddenly stabs Akihito with a sword formed out of her own blood and is shocked to discover that Akihito is an immortal \"half-youmu\"\u2014the offspring of a supernatural creature, called a youmu, and a human. After learning that Mirai is a Spirit World Warrior (\u7570\u754c\u58eb, Ikaishi?)\u2014specialists who protect humans from being affected by youmu\u2014and the last surviving member of her spirit hunting clan, their lives become intertwined as Akihito seeks to help Mirai gain the confidence to kill youmu so that she may stop attempting to kill him as practice.\n\nIn Beyond the Boundary, youmu (\u5996\u5922, y\u014dmu?, alt. Dreamshade) are supernatural creatures that appear throughout the series and can only be seen by those with a supernatural affinity. They are said to be the physical materialization of human animosity such as negative emotions including hatred, jealousy and malice and therefore as long as humans exist, youmu will continue to exist. They can exist in many types of shapes and forms with some even having a human appearance. There are also rare cases when a youmu and a human mate may produce an offspring, which is called Half-Youmu (\u534a\u5996, Han-Y\u014d?, \"Half-Shade\"). Most youmu are relatively docile and coexist with humans without them even aware of their presence. However, there are times when a youmu's behavior upsets the balance, so the Spirit World Warriors are sent in to kill them. Upon death, a youmu produces a Youmu Stone (\u5996\u5922\u77f3, Y\u014dmu Ishi?, alt. Dreamshade Stone) which can be appraised and traded, hence providing a source of income for a Spirit World Warrior.",
