  "plot": "Spike is busy building the doghouse of his dreams when Jerry suddenly runs out, being chased by Tom. Tom steals one of Spike's doghouse boards to attack Jerry with until Jerry perches on Spike's head and Tom ends up hitting Spike and smashing his house. Tom tries to flee, but Spike stops him by his tail, threatening to kill him if he wrecks his doghouse again.\n\nSpike throws Tom into a power pole, where the mailbox falls onto the cat. Tom sneaks under the mailbox to safety and before narrowly missing Jerry as the mouse walks past him. The two dig under Spike's house, but Tom unknowingly carries Spike on his back until Spike knocks Tom out with a hammer. However, Tom falls backwards out of control and dumps Spike on top of his house before escaping.\n\nSpike then begins painting his house red, but Jerry sends Tom sliding on rollerskates, knocking Spike's house out of position. Spike, unbeknownst to him, begins painting Tom red until spotting him. Tom picks up Spike's axe in defense and threatens the dream house. Tom mocks Spike by squeezing his nose, but the axe then falls off the handle. Tom quickly knocks Spike out with the handle and flees as an unconscious Spike falls onto his dream house, destroying it.\n\nTom hides, but quickly spots Jerry. Tom activates a roller to mow Jerry down with as Spike completes his doghouse and begins sleeping. Spike holds out his hand to stop Tom, but Tom still mows right over him, making Spike an arrow shape. Tom chases Jerry into his mousehole and lights a firework, which Jerry promptly throws into Spike's doghouse. Tom tries to stop Spike from looking inside, but Spike pushes him away and looks inside anyway as the firework explodes in his face.\n\nTom chases Jerry up a power pole and chops it with an axe, causing the power pole to fall onto Spike as he is repairing his house. Spike frantically moves to the front yard, but the pole still crushes his home. An annoyed Spike rebuilds his home in a tree, but Tom follows Jerry up the tree and chops it down with an axe as Jerry climbs to the top. Spike watches helplessly as the tree falls down, taking him with it.\n\nSpike and Jerry finally peacefully sleep in Spike's dreamhouse, but Tom spots Jerry from through a hole in the fence and lassoes him around his waist. Jerry wakes up as he's being pulled off the house and pulls the rope back, launching Tom into the fence. Tom pulls back as Jerry ties the rope onto Spike's doghouse. Spike gets pulled all the way into the fence, destroying his doghouse once again.\n\nTom, not knowing the change, keeps pulling, slamming Spike against the fence before using the nearby fire hydrant as a pulley. Tom tosses Spike into the air and tries to flee, only for Spike to catch him though the hole by his tail and begin to pull him back repeatedly just as Tom had done to him. Spike and Jerry then work as partners to finish Spike's dreamhouse, planning while whipping Tom and forcing him to carry out the actions.",
