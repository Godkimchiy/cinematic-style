  "overview": "What defines us as normal? The Madness Among Us delves into the life\r inside a psychiatric hospital and its adjacent outpatient resource centre\r in Salvador, Bahia, depicting the stories and lives of its characters, some\r of whom vacillate between living on their own and being institutionalized,\r between \u201csanity\u201d and \u201cinsanity,\u201d revealing the boundaries of what is\r considered sane. Beautifully filmed with a contemplative pace that allows\r the viewer to enter the intimate space of the mostly female protagonists,\r the documentary asks us to reflect on the inner contradictions, conflicts,\r desires and errors of our own lives. The film is a realistic portrayal of the\r paradoxes facing the characters in their reintegration back into society\r and the treatment of mental illness in Brazil.",
  "storyline": "Leonor and Elizangela do not appear crazy at first sight in the way that society often imagines. They are victims of violent and uncontrollable seizure, which sometimes result even during filming in forcible confinement. The rest of the time they are endowed with sensitivity and clarity about their condition, which offers anyone who will listen to them the opportunity to familiarize themselves with what madness is, through their words, and also through their tragic and touching destinies.",
