  "overview": "Louise simultaneously discovers that she is pregnant and that her mother is seriously ill. Happiness and guilt, euphoria and sadness, filial love and love, period. She'll need a good nine months to cope with all this.",
  "storyline": "Based on Justine Levy's bestseller, \"Mauvaise Fille\" tells the story of 25 year-old Louise who learns in the course of one day that she is pregnant with her first child and that her mother is having a relapse of a deadly cancer. Louise's actor-boyfriend Pablo lives life to the fullest and is madly in love with her. Her father, a rock star, is constantly hopping from airplanes to luxury hotels to concert stages. As one life ends and another begins, Louise tries to finesse her way through a very delicate, difficult period. Her experiences are funny, sad and bittersweet. Like Justine Levy's books. And like life itself.",
  "plot": "Dan (Ella Chen) is a high school tomboy who has developed a mindset that most males are bad and like to bully females because of watching her mother cried over a \"bad man movie\" when she was young, ever since then she has stood up to any males that bully females. Together with her friends Pei (Da Yuan) and Mi (Beatrice Fang) they formed a group calling themselves \"Bad Girls\" to stand up for all females that are bullied by males. One day at Dan's school a film crew along with Taiwan's #1 male idol Justin (Mike He) is there to film a romance idol movie, while chasing her younger sister around her school for making fun of her, Dan accidentally stumbles on to the filming area without noticing and injures the lead actress Jessica (Mandy Wei). Justin suggest that Dan become the new lead actress to compensate for injuring Jessica. Dan refuses, denying that she had any fault in what happened but when her school principal threatens to call her mother to school Dan agrees to being the new lead actress. At first she thinks filming a movie will be a piece of cake until she has to put in a lot of effort in acting for her role and experiencing the behind the scenes of what it takes to make an movie. As filming progresses she gets to know Justin better and realizes that his passion is not being an actor but baking. She also starts falling for Justin and realizes that not all males are as bad as she thinks.",
