Their revenge will be merciless. Lili may be the only one who can halt this unexpected war between man and dog.",
  "storyline": "A cautionary tale between a superior species and its disgraced inferior - Favoring pedigree dogs, a new regulation puts a severe tax on mixed breeds. Owners dump their dogs and shelters become overcrowded. 13-year-old Lili fights desperately to protect her pet Hagen, but her father eventually sets the dog free on the streets.",
  "plot": "The film follows the mixed-breed dog Hagen, who moves with his 13-year old guardian Lili into the home of Lili's estranged father. Unwilling to pay a harsh \"mongrel\" fine imposed by the Hungarian government, Lili's father indicates that he wishes to abandon Hagen. Lili rebels against her father and brings Hagen to her music class, where he disrupts the class, to the chagrin of her music teacher. The teacher orders Lili to remove the dog from the class, and Lili removes him but defiantly she leaves too. Lili's father then abandons Hagen on the side of the road. Hagen chases their car but is unable to catch them. Hagen then is captured by a man who sells him to a dog fighter. He is treated cruelly and trained to kill. In his first fight, he kills his opponent and escapes. He is caught by animal control officers and brought to the city dog pound. Meanwhile, Lili goes to a party where she drinks alcohol and is caught by the police in possession of drugs. Her father picks her up at the police station, where he cries, she realizes that he loves her, they reconcile, and she rejoins her music class to prepare for a concert. Meanwhile, Hagen escapes from the pound after killing one of the staff. 250 other dogs follow him out of the pound into the city and start an organised uprising against their human oppressors. The dogs wreak mayhem in the city and Hagen attacks and kills several people who harmed him. The pack interrupts the concert where Lili is playing, and Lili realizes that Hagen is one of the pack. She then leaves the concert hall by bicycle to find Hagen. Determined to find Lili again, Hagen goes to the meat inspection/slaughterhouse to find her dad, followed by the pack of dogs. Hagen approaches Lili, growling in a threatening manner, and her father emerges from the building with a dehairing blowtorch. Lili plays the trumpet and all the dogs lie down in the yard in a gesture of reconciliation. Lili then lies down as well and her father puts down the blowtorch and lies down beside her.",
