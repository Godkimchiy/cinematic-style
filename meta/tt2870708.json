He and his wife are barely getting by financially and Aidan passes his time by fantasizing about being the great futuristic Space-Knight he'd always dreamed he'd be as a little kid. When his ailing father can no longer afford to pay for private school for his two kids and the only available public school is on its last legs, Aidan reluctantly agrees to attempt to home-school them.

  "plot": "This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (July 2014)\nAidan Bloom (Braff) is a 35-year-old father of two struggling to be an actor in L.A. while his wife, Sarah (Hudson) works a tedious data job. In order to send their kids, Tucker (Pierce Gagnon) and Grace (King) to a good school, they rely on help from Aidan's father, Gabe (Patinkin), who insisted they go to an Orthodox Jewish day school.\n\nWhen Gabe reveals his cancer has come back, he tells Aidan that he's decided to put the rest of his money into a new stem cell treatment, meaning his grandchildren can no longer afford to attend their school. After the school refuses to provide any aid to the Blooms, Sarah suggests that Aidan homeschool his kids, and their adventure of self-discovery begins. Through teaching them about life his way, Aidan gradually discovers some of the parts of himself he couldn't find.\n\nHis brother Noah (Josh Gad) is a shut-in who can only be bribed to babysit for his brother and refuses to see his dying father, from whom he is estranged. Noah falls for his neighbor Janine (Greene) who is a furry costume maker, which gives him the idea to impress her by making a costume for Comic-Con.",
