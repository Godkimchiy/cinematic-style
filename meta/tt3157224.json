  "overview": "A group of aging London gangsters go on a vigilante killing spree when one of their number is murdered by a street gang.",
  "storyline": "When retired East End villain Charlie Archer is murdered by a feral street gang, his brother Ritchie returns to London from Spain to investigate.",
  "plot": "The death threats against the local pharmacist Arturo Manno do not surprise any of his friends because he is a known womanizer in his small town. They do not take him seriously until Manno, together with his friend Dr. Antonio Roscio are killed during a hunting party early morning. Suspicion falls on a father and two brothers of a 16-year-old girl who supposedly had relations with Manno. But Professor Laurana, who had seen one of the letters of extortion, does not believe in the guilt of these illiterates from a rundown neighborhood since the letters of the anonymous notes have been made with clippings from the Osservatore Romano - a Christian newspaper that has few subscribers in the area.\n\nHe asks his lawyer friend Rosello to take care of the prisoners, and begins his own research, also motivated by his secret love for the widow of the murdered man - Luisa Roscio. His trail leads him to Palermo, but he realizes that Luisa Roscio does not reciprocate his feelings and that his detective work has some incomprehension. He only briefly survives the isolation from Luisa because he is murdered and his body disappears. Life in his native village continues unchanged, supported by the close link between Luisa Roscio and the lawyer Rosello.",
