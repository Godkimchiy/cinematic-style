  "plot": "Aiden Ashley's family life was torn apart thirteen years earlier when her online stalker tracked her down to her home and in an avalanche of terror, murdered both her parents. Her stalker fled the crime scene without ever revealing his face to Aiden.\n\nAs a precaution, Aiden shuns the Internet for the next thirteen years, opting to stay off-line, attending therapy sessions and living in seclusion. She breaks this seclusion after her friend and art dealer, Winton Cornelis, convinces her to hold a public art gala showcasing her work. The gala marks a turn in her personal life, after she becomes romantically involved with a guest, Paul Rogers.\n\nMeanwhile, Detective James Page continues to work on the unsolved case of Aiden's parents' murder. Page hires Jack Dayton, a cyber-security whiz, to research Aiden\u2019s life. Dayton makes the shocking discovery that Aiden\u2019s stalker continues to lurk. Aiden's stalker follows her undetected and installs secret cameras in her home.\n\nSuspicion turns to Aiden's art dealer, with the discovery of suspicious financial transactions between his and Aiden's bank accounts. Things do not also appear as they seem as Aiden's love interest Paul's violent past is revealed. Furthermore, Detective Page's involvement is curious; he is the only one meticulously following a cold case after thirteen years. Gradually Aiden's stalker becomes ever more desperate to be a part of her life. But Aiden is determined not to let this man blow her life apart once more. Jack Dayton is the killer and is shot by Detective Page.",
