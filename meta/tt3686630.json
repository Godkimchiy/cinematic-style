  "overview": "A resentful entity continued to reincarnate back to the Saha World in search for his lost love while fighting on a losing battle against the secret guardians of the underworld.",
  "storyline": "In the Latter Day of the Saha World, Taven and the Coalition of Justice (or COJ) were fighting a 10,000-year-old battle against the manifestation of the Fundamental Darkness, who controlled Viro, a timeless drifter. Viro comes back to the Saha World repeatedly in search for Chloe, his lost love. But his evil entity is not allowed to stay in this world as the COJ and Taven will hunt him down whenever he is discovered. The hostility is brutal, and the challenge of being with Chloe again seems impossible. People are being manipulated to do him harm, and they spread evil words about him, generating fear among others. So the only way for him to stay together with Chloe, and stop the cycle, is to fight back!",
