  "overview": "Six college kids find internet stardom when they make \"Truth or Dare\" videos with a violent twist. It is all fun and games until their number one fan decides he wants to play by his own rules.",
  "storyline": "Ray, his sister Courtney, Jennifer, Michelle, Tony and John are all members of a group named the \"Truth or Dare-Devils\". They're known for their outrageous YouTube videos where they take the party game Truth or Dare? to extreme levels, which eventually gains them significant media attention and a decent fan following. It's at one of their guest appearances that they have a confrontation with Derik, an obsessed fan that is angry that they haven't responded to all of his e-mails. He's also upset that there are elements of the group's videos that have been faked for dramatic effect and the scenes of gore and violence aren't real. The group ultimately dismisses Derik as just an over-the-top obsessed fan and head to John's home to rest, only to become horrified when they realize that Derik has followed them and is intent on making new Truth or Dare-Devils videos that are all too real.",
