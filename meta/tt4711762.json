  "overview": "British Prime Minister Winston Churchill suffers from a stroke in the summer of 1953 that's kept a secret from the rest of the world.",
  "storyline": "In June 1953, two years after he was re-elected as Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill collapses following a dinner party at 10 Downing Street. Diagnosed by his doctor Lord Moran as having a stroke, there are fears that he may not survive, and he is taken to his country home Chartwell. Publicly, he is said to be suffering from exhaustion and the newspaper owners consent to printing the deception. As his children arrive to watch over him, they feud over son Randolph's drinking and daughter Sarah's less than illustrious film career while Winston's wife Clemmie reflects on the loss of another daughter who died in infancy. The Cabinet is informed of events as Moran brings in plain-spoken Yorkshire nurse Millie Appleyard to look after the great man. With her help and his wife's devotion, Churchill survives to address the Conservative party conference later in the year, before retiring as premier two years later, the country as a whole being unaware all along of Churchill's secret.",
  "plot": "In summer 1953, some eighteen months after Churchill has become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom for a second time, he suffers a serious stroke. Though his illness is kept as secret as possible his political friends and foes begin to plot his successor when it is unclear whether he will recover or not. He is nursed back to health by Millie Appleyard.",
