  "overview": "Sicixia is a fiction feature-length film shot in Costa da Morte (Galicia, Spain). Sicixia is an intended peripheral film. Periphery is where the world gets different, not where it ends. For Romans, Finisterrae was the end of the world. Sicixia wants it to start from here. Sicixia portrays Costa da Morte's unique heritage by intertwining fiction and reality, powerful images with subtle and rich sounds and stories.",
  "storyline": "SICIXIA. From Greek, syzygos, literally yoked together. Any pair, usually of opposites. The nearly straight-line configuration of three celestial bodies (eclipse or full moon). As a sound engineer, Xiao is sent to Coast of Death to record the most representative sounds in Finisterrae, the end of the world for Romans. There he meets Olalla, who collects seaweed in the Atlantic Ocean. As she guides him through an amazing soundscape their lives will go beyond their control like tides ruled by unknown laws.",
