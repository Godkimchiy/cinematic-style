  "storyline": "Captain William Stanaforth is on a one-way solo mission to take the first steps in colonizing Mars. Like all pioneers throughout history, Stanaforth will face insurmountable odds and life and death decisions as he rockets bravely through space.",
  "plot": "Captain William Stanaforth (Strong) is on a one-way solo mission to Mars, taking humanity\u2019s first steps towards colonizing it. Although the entire world is watching him, he is completely alone on the space ship. After liftoff and the subsequent rocket separations, Stanaforth takes his suit off to relax and is set on course to Mars by the team on the ground.\n\nThrough flashbacks we see how Stanaforth had come up with the idea to create water (H2O) by supercompressing sand/dirt and combining the separate hydrogen and oxygen byproducts. It is by this synthesis that the mission is made possible.\n\nStanaforth's water generation apparatus malfunctions during his mission to Mars. Rather than return to earth as protocol requires, he takes manual control of his space craft and continues to Mars. His spacecraft becomes entangled with nebula and through voice over we hear Stanaforth ruminate on the nature of matter and space. Stanaforth says, \"This is why I came here. To give everything up. For one moment of pure wonder.\"\n\nStanaforth is then seen in his space suit, exiting the space craft.\n\nWithout explanation, the scene cuts to Stanaforth in his space craft preparing to land on Mars. Stanaforth lands on, then walks, on Mars. As he walks, we hear Stanaforth say, \"Nothing has ever lived here. Nothing has even died here. Maybe I'll live forever.\"",
