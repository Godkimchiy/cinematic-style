This Installment features the comeback of Janice de Belen and Herbert Bautista which both starred in past Shake, Rattle and Roll installments, especially Shake, Rattle and Roll I which included both of them but in different episodes.",
  "storyline": "Critically acclaimed director Chito S. Ro\u00f1o embarks on creating the three episodes titled: Pamana, Lost Command and Unwanted. Graded A by the Cinema Evaluation Board, Chito S. Ro\u00f1o elevates the Shake, Rattle & Roll series to a level that is sane and sentient. Each episode has an enticing story and well-executed script. Pamana tells the story of four cousins who receive news of an inheritance from a deceased uncle, who happens to be a famous horror writer for comic books. Amidst the group's bickering, the comics writer's creations come to life to test them. Lost Command is about a battalion of soldiers exploring an unknown forest and fights off a zombie plague. Unwanted tells the story of the couple Hank and Kate, who are trapped in a mall after it collapses due to mysterious causes. Along the way, they meet several other survivors who help them solve the mystery.",
  "plot": "Pamana\n\nFour cousins: an emigrant, narcissistic Myra (Janice de Belen), eloquent Faye (Arlene Mulach) and former clergyman Donald (Herbert Bautista) gather in their late uncle's house to get their inheritance of 5 million pesos each. Their uncle's butler told them if one of them dies within a month, his/her inheritance goes to the others. Each of them were given the responsibility of taking care of a comic book written by their uncle. The cousins show no interest to their comic books, except Donald, and throw it away. Meanwhile, their emigrant cousin was killed by Filomena, a malakat from one of his uncle's comics.\n\nThey return to their uncle's house only to find out the butler had died. When the clock strikes midnight, the characters in the comics came to life. Donald, with help from Rosalda, the pianist ghost, had discovered there was an even stronger character, Buboy ang Munting Diablo/Buboy the Child Demon. Buboy kills them one by one.\n\nWhen morning came, it was only Myra and her daughter, Gladys, who survived. They rushed out of the house. When they got into a taxi, Myra's stepson, Filemon, follows and gives Myra four checks worth 5 million pesos each. It was actually Buboy who had impersonated Filemon who gave her the checks. As they leave, the taxi radio announces the imminent arrival of the plane carrying Benigno Aquino, Jr.\nLost Command\n\nMembers of the Philippine Army's Special Unit 21 led by 1Lt. Bert Garces (Rommel Padilla) and MSgt. Martin Barrientos (Dennis Trillo) are sent on a mission to counter insurgencies in the remote jungles of Mindanao perpetrated by a certain Kapitan Baltog, leader of a lost command squad now known as Alsa Puersa.\n\nFollowing the insurgents' trail, the group goes to Barangay Pototan where Barrientos meets Bunag (Makisig Morales), a local who claims \"undead soldiers\" were \"recruiting\" his father. An unexpected encounter leaves a third of the platoon missing including Garces as the insurgents abducted them. Barrientos decides to rescue Garces and the others, despite Corp. Upaon's (Paulo Avelino) suggestion to notify base and get back-up. Bunag volunteers to become the group's guide.\n\nThe group later encounters the blind Linda (Ella Cruz) in the forest and offers to lead them to her father, leader of a group fighting what she confirms to be zombies. Upon voices his doubts, and could neither radio base nor convince Barrientos to go back. 1Pvt. Conde (Martin Escudero), meanwhile, voices his support of Barrientos' decision not to abandon their teammates so they push on ahead to a part of the forest that not even Bunag was familiar with.\n\nLinda's father (Ronnie Lazaro) turns out to be a zombie, and has been using his daughter to bring in the unsuspecting new \"recruits\". An undead Garces shows up, revealing he has retained his intellect and urges the remaining soldiers to join the \"new army\". Barrientos and his men put up a gallant but short-lived stand causing them to become captives.\n\nUpaon manages to radio for back-up before being dragged away by a zombie as Barrientos regains consciousness and meets a zombified vigilante named Col. Rolando Palma (Roi Vinzon), revealing himself to be Kapitan Baltog and formed the Alsa Puersa which aims to replace the current army starting with the zombified Special Unit 21. Palma also explains he was zombified somehow due to tainted food provisions. Refusing to accept defeat after being surrounded by the undead, Barrientos manages to rescue Upaon after detonating a nearby cache. However, he is forced to euthanize Upaon who has begun to change after being forced to consume tainted meat.\n\nMeanwhile, Conde narrowly escapes his zombified platoon and finds Barrientos. The two try to escape but get separated along the way. Conde ends up encountering a soldier who can seemingly change into a normal human, and the outcome is left unknown. Barrientos, on the other hand, encounters Linda's father who offers to help him escape in exchange for getting Linda out of the forest. He also explains the zombies are somehow unable to cross bodies of water, so he pushes Barrientos into a nearby river before being mauled by the zombie soldiers. Barrientos is found and rescued by an Army helicopter due to Upaon's earlier distress call.\n\nAs Barrientos recuperates in a military hospital ward, the nurse informs him that he is not the only survivor of his unit. Garces and Upaon are seen in the beds next to his, revealing that they too can morph. The ending scene shows a zombie soldier attacking a nurse.\nUnwanted\n\nHank (Vhong Navarro) and his pregnant girlfriend Kate (Lovi Poe) goes to the mall to retrieve their gift for their parents to announce their engagement. Hank leaves Kate outside the gift shop to get their gift.
