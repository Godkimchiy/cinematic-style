  "overview": "An American photographer adrift in a remote Icelandic community becomes entangled in the lives of a mysterious European couple.",
  "storyline": "Set against Iceland's dramatic landscape, Autumn Lights is a story of morality, virtue, and relationships as seen through the eyes of a foreigner in a strange land. The story follows David, an introverted American photographer adrift in remote Iceland while on assignment. When he gets caught in a local investigation after discovering a deserted body washed ashore, David is temporarily bound to a place he doesn't call home and he acquaints himself with the few inhabitants in the area, among them Marie, an Italian woman whose shiftiness betrays not only her beautiful face but her Icelandic husband J\u00f3hann and his own unruffled demeanor. As days pass, David's fascination with the couple intensifies and he slowly begins to find himself entangled in their mysterious lives.",
