  "synopsis": "Krasno is the lake near city Sumperk, where Michal's mother was found dead. It's bad enough to live with feeling that the death of your mom might be involved with your own father. This is unfortunately the suspicion which Michal must deal with. In real life, as in this film, we have to deal with the fact that all we have are assumptions, suspicions, failing nerves and unfinished ideas. Michal decides to take justice into his own hands. Michal and Adam, childhood friends, after twenty years return to their hometown. Michal's mother is dead for several years, Michal's father dies on the day of their arrival. All that remains is the feeling that something was wrong. Sadness and anger, inability to find out the truth. Father's new wife behave just like she confirms the suspicion. Or is it that they both want to see it confirmed. They decide to come across to the bottom. Everything is different than it is in the film. Life is never black and white. A black and white matter is not dealt with easily.... Despite all the above, the film is kind of black comedy. Sometimes more black than comedy, but the situation would be absurd. Where and how to find assassin in small town? Backdrop of the story is the city Sumperk. Real, but for both main protagonist is a ghost town. Both live here twenty years ago. Nothing is as it was. Their town no longer exists. Who are they? Are they living in history or present? Are they living to uncover the truth or are they living in delusion? These are all questions that should be answered in this movie. But the answer? Where to find it?"
