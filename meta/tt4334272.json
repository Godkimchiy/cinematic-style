  "overview": "The 94 years old Alma is a passionate environmentalist. She doesn\u2019t like the deforestation of the rain forests at all, that the Germans eat ever more meat, and that animals are fattened in concentrated animal feeding operations across the country. The pensioner looks for equal minded people via adverts in the local papers and  gets to know the young kindergarten worker Vicky. Both participate in a group meeting in the restaurant \u201cLos Veganeros\u201d, where they and other environmental activists plan their projects. During one of these meetings Vicky propose to abduct the pig fattening industrialist Heinz Granitzka to force the public to take notice of the horrible conditions the animals are being forced to live in. The group all but jumps at that idea and start to carry it out, with fatal results.",
