The elevator is in a New York building where Jack Tramell lives. The woman, Kathryn, has studied her sons revenge meticulously. It is a quiet evening of the Labour Day weekend. Kathryn is cynical and scientific in carrying out her plan. But is she insane or is there truth in her accusations? Is Tramell guilty, or is he caught up in a deathly game not of his making?\nThe Elevator is a drama and a psychological thriller, that keeps the audience on the edge of his seat through a series of sudden twists and nail biting tension."
