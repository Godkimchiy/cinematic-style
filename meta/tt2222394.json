  "overview": "Tells the \"riches to rags\" story of the Nobles, three upper-class twenty-somethings that appear to have no limits to their checkbooks, and no direction in their lives. Until one day, their father tries to teach them a lesson by staging a financial scandal that forces the whole family to escape to an old house in the poor side of town, and leads the \"kids\" to do what they haven't done before: get jobs.",
  "storyline": "Three spoiled children who are cut off from their family fortune and forced to do the unthinkable - get a job.",
  "plot": "Located in modern Mexico city, \"The Noble family\" tells the story of wealthy mexican businessman Germ\u00e1n Noble, and his three grown children, Javier, B\u00e1rbara, and Carlos.\n\nBeing always busy at his job, Germ\u00e1n doesn't realize that his kids are doing nothing with their lives, while carelessly spending his money. He never touches the subject, for he attributes their attitude to the depression the kids feel in the wake of their mother\u2019s death.\n\nThough Javier works in his father's construction company (in theory), he spends most of his time partying with friends. When not socializing, he dreams up unrealistic, and often, impossible, projects that are often mocked by his father's business partner, Anwar Karim. Hoping to motivate Javier, Germ\u00e1n tells him he plans to leave the company to him in the future, and so he charges Javier with bigger responsibilities. Javier, instead, flies to Miami with his friends, leaving a subordinate to take his place at a very important business reunion.\n\nB\u00e1rbara is a socialite about to get engaged to Peter, a man 20 years older than her, who\u2019s left several failed businesses in bankruptcy. He\u2019s hoping that B\u00e1rbara\u2019s trust fund will help him pay off his enormous tax debt. Germ\u00e1n is against said engagement, but B\u00e1rbara pays no attention to him and starts planning the wedding\n\nCarlos, Germ\u00e1n\u2019s youngest child, is a hipster that has been expelled from college for being caught by the dean having sex with Luc\u00eda, one of his teachers.\n\nGerm\u00e1n\u2019s frustration finally leads him to a heart attack. While in the hospital, he decides to give his children a lesson and a taste of the real world. He tells them that union troubles and an embezzling partner have led the government to freeze his assets and that, as shareholders of the company, the whole family could end up in prison. Germ\u00e1n convinces them to hide and cut off all contact with friends and relatives (to protect his charade), and move into a dilapidated house his father owned in a modest area of Mexico City. The children will also have to support themselves, which means getting jobs for the first time in their lives.\n\nA friend\u2019s father helps Carlos get a job as a bank teller, while Lucho, nephew of the family's old Maid, helps B\u00e1rbara find work as a waitress and Javier as a bus driver.\n\nWith a house falling down around them and bills to pay, the three immediately find themselves struggling to make ends meet. Their new situation causes them to see things in a new light. B\u00e1rbara discovers that Lucho, who she used to think of as poor and unworthy of her time, is actually a nice guy. Javier sees his old party friends as shallow hangers-on. Carlos starts to create some discipline in his life. Germ\u00e1n also learns a lot from his children during this time, and is dismayed to learn that B\u00e1rbara has bulimia, Javier is dyslexic and that he himself often spent too much time at work while they were growing up.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter, B\u00e1rbara's boyfriend, finds out the family's hideout and the truth about Germ\u00e1n\u2019s scheme. Once he finds out it\u2019s all just a plot to teach the kids a lesson, he tries to blackmail Germ\u00e1n into giving him power over B\u00e1rbara\u2019s trust fund. Germ\u00e1n refuses, but in the process he\u2019s forced to admit the truth to his children. The revelation generates a feeling of anger and distrust in them. However B\u00e1rbara realises that Peter's only intention was to obtain her money, and breaks with him. Disappointed, the three siblings decide to distance themselves from their father, keep their jobs and fully repair the old house.\n\nG\u00e9rman's wish to see his children mature and live independently is finally accomplished, even though they break all contact with him. Carlos leaves the bank and gets a real job, Javier opens a business of his own, and B\u00e1rbara and Lucho get engaged.\n\nBy the end of the film we see G\u00e9rman knocking on the, now restored, front door of the old house, the children open, and he asks for forgiveness. They reconcile acknowledging that everything was for a greater good.\n\nAfter the credits Peter is inside a prison cell, for his tax debts, as two fellow inmates approach to molest him.",
  "synopsis": "Germ\u00e1n Noble (Gonzalo Vega), a recently widowed millionaire, after having a pre-heart attack, realizes his two sons, Javi and Cha (Luis Gerardo M\u00e9ndez & Juan Pablo Gil) and daughter B\u00e1rbara (Karla Souza) don't know how to make their own way in the real world. He decides to pull off a charade where he says he's broken and his former partners are after him, so they go hiding into Germ\u00e1n's father's old house, a little place in a poor neighboorhood. While living here, German tells his kids they will have to be more independent, get jobs, and earn their own money. With the help of their maid's nephew, Lucho, they get jobs as a bus driver, a bank employee, and a waitress. As days go bye, Javi, Cha and Barbara, learn to appreciate what they have earned and even grow fond of their job mates. So, the Noble family starts being a more united one, where all four of them will know each other better than any other time. Germ\u00e1n's plan is working until it's compromised by Peter (Juan Carlos Gasc\u00f3n), B\u00e1rbara's boyfriend, who attempts to bribe Germ\u00e1n by putting an end to his whole charade, unless he allows Barbara to marry him, and give him a part of the family's inheritance. Unable to say yes to this terms, Germ\u00e1n tells the truth to his kids, who get mad at him, and yet, go back to their working, independent lives. After Germ\u00e1n asks them to forgive him, they all four have learned a lesson."
