  "overview": "After his engagement ends badly, Josh decides to take advantage of his bachelor-party plans in Ojai, California, with the few friends still willing to join him. Focused on drugs and their own hangups, his self-absorbed friends refuse to confront the elephant in the room and ask Josh how he\u2019s feeling. As welcome and unwelcome guests stop by, Josh will attempt to find some closure over this weekend with the guys.",
  "storyline": "After his engagement suddenly ends, Joshy and a few his friends decide to take advantage of what was supposed to be his bachelor party in Ojai, California. In their attempt to help Joshy deal with the recent turn of events, the guys turn the getaway into a raucous weekend filled with drugs, booze, debauchery, and hot tubs. Written and directed by Jeff Baena and featuring an ensemble cast of hilarious comedic talents-including Thomas Middleditch (HBO's \"Silicon Valley\"), Adam Pally (TV's \"Happy Endings\"), Alex Ross Perry (director of Queen of Earth), Nick Kroll (TV's \"The League\"), Brett Gelman (TV's \"Married\") and Jenny Slate (Obvious Child) -Jeff Baena's sophomore feature is a wickedly amusing portrayal of male bonding and emotional incompetence.",
