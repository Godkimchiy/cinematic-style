  "synopsis": "A Lei da \u00c1gua (Novo C\u00f3digo Florestal) clarifies the changes promoted by the New Forest Code in Brazil and the controversy over its preparation and implementation. The documentary shows how the law directly impacts the forest and thus the water, air, soil fertility, food production and the live of every citizen. Produced over 16 months, the film is based on research and 37 interviews with environmentalists, ruralists, scientists and farmers. The documentary also portrays specific cases of environmental degradation and sustainable agricultural techniques that can reconcile the social interest of conservation and production."
