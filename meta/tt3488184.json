  "overview": "Larry is an unqualified, unemployable, inebriated prankster who rides a tide of booze onto the glorious shores of an undiscriminating Quick-Lube.  Taking a part-time job vacuuming and washing windshields, Larry finds himself mixed up with hostile co-workers and unsatisfied customers, while also finding himself smitten with his lovely boss, Lupe Torrez.  Will Larry keep it together long enough to win the girl, provide for man's best friend (his dog Arrow), and do his grandmother proud?",
  "storyline": "Larry (Jason Schwartzman) is content with his dog Arrow and booze, barely tolerating anything or anyone else. His marginally successful relationships include his grandmother, who keeps him afloat financially, and his best friend Norwood, who provides him with pharmaceuticals. But a chance encounter at a Jiffy Lube gives Larry a beguiling new boss and the impetus to head in another direction for a while. This movie showcases all that may be needed to help a person get unstuck in life: love (or an unrequited crush), friendship (or someone your family likes better than you) and family (or in this case a grandmother who will support you whenever you get fired from a job).",
  "plot": "In this quirky comedy, Larry (Jason Schwartzman) along with his trusty sidekick French bulldog Arrow (Schwartzman's real life pet), goes through life as a misanthropic outcast looking for work and a purpose in life.",
  "synopsis": "Jason Schwartzman portrays Larry, an inebriated sad sack who rides a tide of booze onto the shores of an undiscriminating Quick-Lube. The only bright spot is probably his boss, Lupe (Eleanore Pienta).Will Larry keep it together long enough to win the girl, provide for his French bulldog (Schwartzman's real-life dog Arrow), laze about with his friend Major (TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe), and do his cantankerous grandmother (Olympia Dukakis) proud?7 Chinese Brothers - written & directed by Bob Byington (Somebody Up There Likes Me) - is empathetic in tone, dry in humor. Schwartzman is in every scene and offers one of his most finely nuanced performances."
