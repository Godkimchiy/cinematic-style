  "overview": "Two oafs must rescue their stranded pal in Mexico.",
  "storyline": "Convinced that his buddy Nardo (Thomas Middleditch) is making the mistake of a lifetime by marrying Tracy (Shannon Woodward), Jason (T.J. Miller) puts a dramatic end to their wedding. When the furious bride decides to take her Baja honeymoon solo, Nardo follows her-where the lovesick groom is carjacked and left stranded, naked and penniless in a remote part of the Mexican desert. Helpless, Nardo sends out an SOS to Jason and their pal Evan (Adam Pally), an up-and-coming ad exec slated for an important business meeting the next morning. During their ridiculous attempt to rescue Nardo, the trio embarks on a series of increasingly outrageous misadventures involving con artists, drug smugglers and even the Federales.",
  "plot": "Daniel \"Nardo\" Narducci (Thomas Middleditch) is having a bachelor party with his best friends, Jason (T. J. Miller) and Evan (Adam Pally). He tells his friends he isn't sure he is doing the right thing. The next day in the middle of the wedding Jason tries to stop Nardo from getting married, which makes the bride Tracy (Shannon Woodward) storm out.\n\nTracy goes alone to the honeymoon vacation in Mexico. Nardo goes after her to get her back, but on his way he is carjacked and left naked. He calls Jason for help. Jason puts Evan in the car while he is asleep and heads towards Mexico. They stop in California in order to get a fake ID because Jason has lost his.\n\nNardo arrives at a town in Mexico and calls again, he is next to a wire service company and Evan offers to send him money through it. They go to a casino to meet a friend who can help them transfer the money. Evan hits on a girl in the casino, but she drugs him and takes him to a room in order to steal his kidney. Jason finds Evan and eventually rescues him from the criminals. While escaping, one of the criminals shoot them with burning arrows and one arrow hits the car, the car then burns and explodes.\n\nFailing to get any money, the woman who agreed to help Nardo gets angry and he runs from her (naked) and jumps right into a cocaine pickup truck. When found, he is tied to a chair. At some point Nardo frees himself and runs away with the truck. He gets to see Tracy through a hotel window but before he gets to her, he gets caught by a guard and sent to jail.\n\nAfter that, Nardo sends for help by making a phone call to Evan. The rescue is successful, and Nardo and Tracy get married.\n\nThe post-credits scene shows that Berk is coming for revenge.",
