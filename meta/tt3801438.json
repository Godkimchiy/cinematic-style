  "plot": "Grumpy Cat (voiced by Aubrey Plaza) is a lonely cat living in a pet shop located in a mall that is slated to be closed. She's bitter at being constantly passed over by other animals in the store, but is surprised to find that she can communicate with Chrystal (Megan Charpentier), an equally lonely 12-year-old girl that is equally shocked that Grumpy Cat can talk. The two are initially at odds with one another, but start to befriend each other, especially after a high-priced dog (voiced by Stephen Stanton) is dognapped from the pet shop.",
