  "overview": "Based on the best-selling novel, A CHRISTMOOSE STORY brings to life the tale of an unlikely friendship between a young boy and a large, talking moose. Young Max has low expectations for his first Christmas after his parents\u2019 divorce, when suddenly a large moose crashes through the roof of his garage. And if that isn\u2019t strange enough, the moose claims to have fallen from Santa\u2019s sleigh! But being friends with a moose isn\u2019t all that simple. Especially since Max\u2019s grumpy neighbor has no interest in hanging stockings for Christmas but would love to hang up a pair of moose antlers, and Santa is out there somewhere looking to get his sleigh back!",
  "storyline": "When his father cannot make it home Max is convinced that Christmas will be extremely boring this year. But then Mr. Moose crashes through his roof and he is not so sure anymore. This is a giant talking Moose with a big mouth, a warm hearth and a tendency for drama. He claims he was on a test-run with Santa Claus, lost control over the sleigh and crashed, injuring his leg. And now he has to find Santa Claus, otherwise nobody will receive their Christmas gifts. Is Max able to get Mr. Moose and Santa flying again?",
