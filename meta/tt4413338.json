  "overview": "A disenfranchised 16-year-old girl connects to an older man on the internet and after a brief one-sided affair descends into obsession and anorexia.",
  "storyline": "Based on the autobiographical novel by Cielo Latini, the film tells the story of a teenager who falls in love and starts dating an older man whom she met on the Internet. Submerged in a shallow world, without any friends and with adults who can barely understand the adolescence, the relationship becomes an obsession for her, a loquacious, incisive and dizzying narrator who guides us through a story of unrequited love where the option of starving herself becomes the illusion of a perfect life.",
  "plot": "Cielo (Mar\u00eda Eugenia Su\u00e1rez) is a teenage girl from La Plata, who falls in love with Alejo (Esteban Lamothe), a man from Avellaneda, nine years older than her. They met on an online dating service, where Cielo used the username \"Abzurdah\". She fell in love with him, but he only dated her to have sex. Eventually he dropped her because of the distance between their cities, and she developed anorexia because of it. She tried to reopen their relationship, but he only had sex with her and continued his relations with his new girlfriends. Cielo started a blog glorifying anorexia as a lifestyle, which was closed by the server after a couple of months. The anorexia eventually drove her to an unsuccessful suicide attempt.",
