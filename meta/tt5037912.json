  "overview": "An artist realizes that the story that he is illustrating, about a ghost who was an inmate of an asylum in a forest, could be real. Meanwhile, an aspiring actress takes up a challenge to watch a horror film all alone in the theatre at night. How are these storylines connected?",
  "storyline": "Apsara is a single mother under a lot of debt and tries to make a living by acting in adverts and lives with her friend Swathi who is an assistant director. Swathi's current project dwells around the character of 'Maya', based on one of the inmates of an asylum in the woods outside of Chennai and about the rumours about mysterious deaths around the asylum ever since Maya died decades ago. When Apsara gets to watch the movie as part of a publicity contest that will test the fear factor, her life changes by the surreal experience that she never expected.",
