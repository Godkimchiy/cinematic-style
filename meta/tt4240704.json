  "overview": "Sebastian Maniscalco examines the shameless behaviors of our modern society - from the small daily annoyances to the publicly obnoxious - when he asks, \"Aren't You Embarrassed?\" This new, one-hour comedy special is deeply relatable and highly entertaining as it is inspired by real-life irritations that keep audiences rolling in laughter.",
  "storyline": "Sebastian Maniscalco returns home to Chicago to perform in front of a live sold-out audience in this all-new comedy event. With his inimitable delivery, he burns modern-day society through the lens of his old-world Italian-American upbringing. No topic is off-limits - but perhaps we all should be just a little embarrassed.",
