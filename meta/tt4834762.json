  "overview": "A 40-year old actress (single and strong, yet lonely), her sister (an emotionally unstable schoolteacher whose married-with-kids life appears more orderly) and their domineering father, who gradually loses control over his family due to his wife's sudden illness and his own health troubles; these are the three individuals at the heart of this film, a touching story about the strength of family ties in a situation of imminent danger.",
  "storyline": "Marta is a successful actress unable to put her life in order. Unlike her domineering sister, Kasia is sensitive and effusive. They're not keen on each other but an unexpected illness of their mother forces them to cooperate. Laughter is liberating in this heart-warming and profound story about family relations.",
  "plot": "Christian Nielsen returns home to Australia from the US for the wedding of his father Henry to his much younger housekeeper Anna. He finds out that Charlotte, the wife of his childhood friend Oliver, had an affair with his father, and their daughter Hedvig is actually his father's daughter. After he tells Oliver, Oliver leaves his wife and tells his daughter he can not look at her, after which she tries to commit suicide with her grandfather's shotgun. Oliver and Charlotte reunite in the hospital, where Hedvig recovers from the unsuccessful suicide attempt.",
