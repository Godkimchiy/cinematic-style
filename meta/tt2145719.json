  "overview": "How do white South Africans deal with their fears of crime and violence? Like crocodiles, some survive without evolving, living with their fears. Others make fear their friend and evolve in ways you'd never imagine.",
  "storyline": "\"This is how we live here... They wait in the bushes and watch us at night but there's nowhere else for us to go...\" After the De Beers were robbed and held hostage by 13 armed men, they turned their remote farm house into a gilded cage with double electric fences, panic alarms, satellite tracking and perimeter searchlights. She and her children live in daily fear. \"How do you teach a child in South Africa not to be afraid?\" asks Johannes, the town's retired pastor,\"it has been so emphasized in our history\". Fear causes people to become more insular, more insecure and the culture of fear feeds on itself. This is a unique and thought-provoking insight into South Africa today. To understand these people who are being pushed to the limit of their imaginations, is to feel their fears and walk in a forest of unknown things.",
