  "overview": "Free to Run tells the amazing story of the running movement over the past five decades, the struggle for the right to run - especially for women \u2013 against conservative Federations, the explosion of grass roots road races and marathons, until the boom of running as a vast business enterprise.",
  "storyline": "Today, all anybody needs to run is the determination and a pair of the right shoes. But just fifty years ago, running was viewed almost exclusively as the domain of elite male athletes who competed on tracks. With insight and propulsive energy, director Pierre Morath traces running\ufffd\u06eas rise to the 1960s, examining how the liberation movements and newfound sense of personal freedom that defined the era took the sport out of the stadiums and onto the streets, and how legends like Steve Prefontaine, Fred Lebow, and Kathrine Switzer redefined running as a populist phenomenon.",
