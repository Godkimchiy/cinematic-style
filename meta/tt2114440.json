The cause of it all goes back to a grave error of judgment made long in the past: a horrific and irreversible spell cast in the wrong place at the wrong time...\nElif sets off on a journey to confront her shadowy past and unravel the mystery behind her terrifying daily ordeal. But its a journey full of unexpected nasty surprises: surprises as unfathomable as they are horrific; surprises that lead Elif into a path from which theres no turning back..."
