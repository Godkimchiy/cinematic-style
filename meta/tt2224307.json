  "plot": "This article needs an improved plot summary. (July 2016)\nPee-wee Herman, a resident of Fairville and a cook at Dan's Diner, meets and befriends actor Joe Manganiello, who convinces Pee-wee to go on the first vacation of his life to reach New York to celebrate Joe's birthday party. Upon leaving Fairville, Pee-wee unintentionally becomes involved with three women who have just robbed a bank: Pepper, Freckles, and Bella. After the women steal his vehicle, Pee-wee gets a car ride from Gordon, a traveling salesman who gives him a disguise kit.\n\nPee-wee spends the night at a farmhouse inhabited by Farmer Brown and his nine daughters, each of whom have a romantic interest in Pee-wee. The next day, Farmer Brown insists that Pee-wee get married to one of his daughters. During the wedding ceremony, Pee-wee uses the disguise kit to flee the church. Pee-wee meets Penny King, an aviator with a flying car who offers to fly him to New York. When the flying car crashes, Pee-wee winds up in the wilderness where he meets Grizzly Bear Dan who shows Pee-wee the way out of the woods but ends up taking Pee-wee to his cave where Pee-wee runs away out of fear and then joins an Amish community, where he encounters the bank robbers.\n\nThat night when the women attempt to steal a horse buggy, Pee-wee convinces them to leave their money behind for the Amish citizens to purchase a replacement. Pee-wee and the women arrive in New York via horse buggy where the three women get arrested. Pee-wee falls down a well just before Joe's birthday party while Joe is feeling sad thinking that Pee-wee was not coming. When Joe hears on the news that Pee-wee fell down the well, Joe rescues Pee-wee while everyone in Fairville and everyone that Pee-wee met on his holiday (except Farmer Brown and his nine daughters and the Amish people) see Pee-wee on the news getting rescued by Joe. Joe and Pee-wee finally attend Joe's party and Pee-wee returns to Fairville back to his job and after work meets with Joe.",
