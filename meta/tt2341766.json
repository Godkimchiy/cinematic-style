While doing this he lies many times to his close friend Sita (Evelyn Sharma) and girlfriend Chitra (Gaelyn Mendonca). The latter ultimately breaks up with him. During this, Ram falls for Nandini who reciprocates his feelings. Meanwhile, Mandar is coming back to normal. Ram feels he is cheating his friend; he breaks-off with Nandini and makes arrangements so that Nandini and Mandar meet. Unfortunately all this is revealed to Mandar and Nandini. Ram ultimately loses his girlfriend, his love and friend.\n\nReturning to present day, the psychiatrist suggests RP to apologise to all three, which may suffice in resolving the problems.
