  "storyline": "Approaching collapse, the nation's economy is quickly eroding. As crime and fear take over the countryside, the government continues to exert its brutal force against the nation's most productive who are mysteriously vanishing - leaving behind a wake of despair. One man has the answer. One woman stands in his way. Some will stop at nothing to control him. Others will stop at nothing to save him. He swore by his life. They swore to find him. Who is John Galt?",
  "plot": "The owner of the 20th Century Motor Company has died and his children have taken over, with a new plan to operate the company: that everyone work as hard as he can, but that salaries be \"based on need\". A lab engineer named John Galt objects and announces, \"I'll stop the motor of the world.\"\n\nTwelve years later, the economy spirals downward. Shortages have grounded airlines and returned the railroads to dominance; regulation has led to financial disaster. Galt seems to be behind the disappearances of corporate executives and other experts. The latest disappearance is that of Dagny Taggart, the executive officer of the largest railroad company, Taggart Transcontinental. She had chased Galt in a private plane and crashed hers.\n\nDagny has reached Galt's Gulch, and Galt himself rescues her from the crashed plane. She meets several \"disappeared\" achievers, such as banker Midas Mulligan, who say they quit after coming to believe that government was enslaving them. On the outside, government develops a classified new weapon called \"Project F\" and nationalizes the railroads, including Taggart Transcontinental.\n\nThe public grows increasingly frustrated with the central planning, comes to view Galt as the solution, and holds rallies calling for him to reform government. Thompson, the Head of State, offers Galt a job in the government, but Galt rebuffs the offer. Later, the government tortures Galt using the power of \"Project F\". However, others from the gulch arrive to free him and they escape back to their refuge.",

In response, the government pursues policies imposing even greater brutality against those remaining.One man has the answer. One woman determined to keep the world running stands in his way. He swore by his life. She swore to stop him.Who is John Galt?"
