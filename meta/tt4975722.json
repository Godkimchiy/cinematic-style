  "overview": "The tender, heartbreaking story of a young man\u2019s struggle to find himself, told across three defining chapters in his life as he experiences the ecstasy, pain, and beauty of falling in love, while grappling with his own sexuality.",
  "storyline": "Three time periods - young adolescence, mid-teen and young adult - in the life of black-American Chiron is presented. When a child, Chiron lives with his single, crack addict mother Paula in a crime ridden neighborhood in Miami. Chiron is a shy, withdrawn child largely due to his small size and being neglected by his mother, who is more concerned about getting her fixes and satisfying her carnal needs than taking care of him. Because of these issues, Chiron is bullied, the slurs hurled at him which he doesn't understand beyond knowing that they are meant to be hurtful. Besides his same aged Cuban-American friend Kevin, Chiron is given what little guidance he has in life from a neighborhood drug dealer named Juan, who can see that he is neglected, and Juan's caring girlfriend Teresa, whose home acts as a sanctuary away from the bullies and away from Paula's abuse. With this childhood as a foundation, Chiron may have a predetermined path in life, one that will only be magnified in terms...",
  "plot": "i. Little\n\nIn Liberty City, Miami, Cuban drug dealer Juan finds Chiron, a withdrawn child who goes by the nickname \"Little\", hiding from a pack of bullies in an abandoned crackhouse. He allows Chiron to spend the night with him and his girlfriend Teresa before returning him to his emotionally abusive mother Paula the next day.\n\nChiron continues to spend time with Juan, who teaches him how to swim and advises him to make his own path in life. One night, Juan sees Paula smoking crack with one of his customers. Juan berates her for her addiction while Paula rebukes him for selling crack to her in the first place. Paula implies she knows her son gets beaten up by his peers for being gay by referencing \"the way he walks.\"\n\nThe next day, Chiron admits to Juan and Teresa that he hates his mother before asking what \"faggot\" means. Juan replies it is okay to be gay and that he should not allow other people to mock him for it. After asking Juan whether or not he sold drugs to Paula, Chiron leaves as Juan hangs his head in shame.\nii. Chiron\n\nNow a teenager, Chiron juggles avoiding his classmate Terrel, who frequently bullies him, and spending time with Teresa, who has lived alone since Juan's death. Paula has become addicted to crack and prostitutes herself to support her addiction, frequently coercing Chiron into giving her money that Teresa lends him.\n\nOne night, Chiron has a dream in which his friend Kevin has sex with a woman in Teresa's backyard. On another night, Kevin visits Chiron at the beach near his house. While smoking a blunt, the two discuss their ambitions and the nickname, \"Black,\" that Kevin has given Chiron. After a charged moment, they kiss and Kevin masturbates Chiron.\n\nThe next morning, Terrel manipulates Kevin into participating in a hazing ritual. Kevin reluctantly punches Chiron until he is unable to get up before Terrel and several others stomp on him. Chiron later meets with a social worker, who urges him to reveal the identities of his attackers. He refuses, however, as he believes that reporting them will not solve anything. The next day, Chiron smashes a chair into Terrel's back. As the police arrest Chiron, he glares at a helpless Kevin.\niii. Black\n\nNow going by the nickname \"Black\", an adult Chiron deals drugs in Atlanta. He receives frequent calls from Paula, who asks him to visit her at the drug treatment center where she now lives. One night, he receives a call from Kevin, who apologizes for his behavior while in high school and invites Chiron to visit him in Miami. The following day, he wakes up after dreaming about Kevin to find that he has had a wet dream.\n\nWhile visiting his mother, Chiron admits that he feels remorse for his lack of empathy towards her. Paula eventually apologizes for having been a bad mother and not supporting him when he needed her. Chiron forgives her. He then travels to Miami and reunites with Kevin, who now waits tables and serves as Chef at a diner. He prepares a \"chef's special,\" but Chiron is reluctant to speak or drink with Kevin.\n\nKevin tells Chiron that he had a child with an old girlfriend but the relationship didn't work out and he is fulfilled by his role as a father. Kevin confesses that he is surprised by Chiron's new athletic appearance, occupation, and motivation for seeing him. After dinner, the two drive to Kevin's home. Kevin tells Chiron that, although his life may not have turned out the way he hoped, he is still happy. Chiron admits he has never been intimate with another person since their encounter on the beach. As Kevin comforts him, Chiron thinks back to his time as a child on the beach.",
  "synopsis": "This film is told through three different points in the protagonist's life.Part I. LittleIn Miami, a drug dealer named Juan (Mahershala Ali) meets with one of his boys near the dope holes in town. A junkie is desperately trying to buy something off the other man, but he is continuously rejected.Juan goes by a hole in which a young boy (Alex Hibbert) has been chased into by a group of bullies. The bullies throw rocks at the window before leaving. Juan pulls off a wooden board from the window and finds the boy hiding. He takes the boy out to get food and asks him his name, but the boy never responds. Juan brings him to the home of his girlfriend Teresa (Janelle Monae), where the boy finally says his name is Chiron, but the other kids call him \"Little.\"The next day, Juan brings Chiron back to his home. His mother Paula (Naomie Harris) brings Chiron inside and keeps him away from Juan as he tries to say his farewell.A group of schoolboys play on a field near the railroad tracks. Chiron leaves the group and is followed by his only friend Kevin (Jaden Piner). Kevin tells Chiron that he needs to show the other boys that he's not soft so they will stop picking on him. They play-fight before running off home.After class, the boys are in a room showing each other their penises. Chiron enters the room after Kevin lets him in. He unzips his pants and shows himself to Kevin and the other boys.Juan takes Chiron to the beach to teach him how to swim. They sit on the sand as Juan tells Chiron about his own childhood, telling the boy how he must carve out his own path in this world and not let anyone else decide for him.At night, Juan sees someone smoking crack in the streets. He discovers that Paula is with the man, being her boyfriend. Juan chastises Paula for smoking crack, but she hits back that he's the one that sold it to her. They argue about how Chiron is being raised, with Paula asking Juan if he is trying to raise her son and if he knows why the other boys pick on him. She later goes home and angrily calls Chiron a faggot.In the morning, Chiron goes to Juan and Teresa's house. He expresses his hatred for Paula and then asks Juan what a faggot is. After Juan explains, Chiron asks if he himself is one. He then asks Juan about his drug-dealing and selling to his mother. Chiron leaves, and Juan appears tearfully remorseful.Part II.

He also gives Chiron the nickname \"Black\".\nChiron continues to visit Teresa for food, a place to crash some nights, and sometimes some money. When Chiron goes back toward his home, a very high Paula comes out and starts demanding money from Chiron so she may get more drugs for herself. She tries to forcibly takes money from his pockets until he relents and hands it over to her.As Chiron walks home from school, Terrel and his buddy run up on Chiron and taunt him about his mother and Teresa. When Chiron responds angrily, the two threaten him and make him take a step back.Chiron visits the beach and sits on the sand. He is joined moments later by Kevin, who shares a blunt with him. They talk to each other about their goals, and eventually get close enough to start kissing. Kevin then gives Chiron a handjob.At school, Chiron tries to sit with Kevin at lunch before Terrel sits with him. They have a pleasant chat as Terrel recalls an old \"game\" called \"Knocked Down, Stay Down,\" which Kevin was apparently good at. Terrel tries to find someone for Kevin to knock down. He picks Chiron and pressures Kevin into hitting him. Kevin reluctantly strikes Chiron a few times in the face and tells him to stay down. Chiron continues to get up, leading to Terrel and his friends to start stomping him out. Later, Chiron sees a social worker who urges him to give up the names of his attackers. He feels that nothing will be stopped if he says names.The next day, Chiron walks into class and immediately grabs a chair and smashes it over Terrel's back, knocking him to the ground. Chiron tries to get more hits in, but he is held back by the teacher and other students. He is later arrested, and Kevin sees him being taken away in the police car..Part III.

Kevin says he'd had a son (Kevin Jr.) with a woman, named Samantha, whom he is married to. When Chiron asks, \"Y'all still down?\", Kevin says, \"Nah, not like that, man,\" although he says he and Samantha are \"cool\" on account of Kevin Jr. Chiron admits that he is selling drugs, to Kevin's displeasure. Chiron claims \"it is what it is\", but Kevin disagrees.Kevin brings Chiron to his apartment for the night. There, Kevin admits that he's not where he thought he would have been in life, but at least he is happy with his job and family. Chiron states that he hasn't been touched by anyone since Kevin back in high school. Chiron and Kevin then sit on the bed with Chiron resting his head on Kevin's shoulder, and Kevin starts stroking Chiron's head.The film ends with a shot of Chiron as a child standing alone on the beach."
