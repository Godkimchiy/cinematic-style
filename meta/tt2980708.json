  "overview": "Everyone hates Ward\u2019s wife and wants her dead, Ward (Donald Faison) most of all. But when his friends\u2019 murderous fantasies turn into an (accidental) reality, they have to deal with a whole new set of problems \u2014 like how to dispose of the body and still make their 3 p.m. tee time. Scott Foley's directorial debut, also starring Foley, Patrick Wilson, Amy Acker, and Nicolette Sheridan, is a blackly comic caper about helping a friend out of a bad relationship by any means necessary.",
  "storyline": "Ward's wife is a bitch. Everyone knows it. Including Ward. After numerous conversations and ruminations on the subject amongst Ward's colorful group of friends, a fortuitous accident leads to a whole new world of problems and possibilities.",
  "plot": null,
  "synopsis": "Four long time male friends see their friendship disturbed by one of their wives, whose sole purpose in life is to rob others of having a good time, including her well-meaning husband. When the plan of the other three - a a figure of speech - becomes reality, the four men and the wives of two of the others work jointly to prevent accident from turning into disaster. As a plot - friendship works and the two couples see their relationship invigorated by the tension and the realization that there is no way back.\nThis movie has many more interesting aspects than the story itself. The friendship between the men and the response of the two women. The self-confident womanizer who has to deal with things alone.The confrontation of people who love and care for each other with a person who consistently abuses one of them. Watching the movie with that in mind gives a different perspective. All actors - even the wicked one - play their role to perfection. Only weakness is the police neighbour who gets stuck between Breaking Bad and the late great John Candy.\nWatch and see beyond the obvious."
