  "overview": "The story is based on the real events of 1985. The team of a Russian polar icebreaker \u201cMikhail Gromov\u201d discovered a giant iceberg. The ship came into collision while attempting to take cover from the weather and is forced to drift with ice along the Amundsen Sea coast. The crew of \u201cGromov\u201d spent 133 days of polar night trying to find a way out of their icy trap. They have no room for mistakes; one wrong move and the vessel is crushed by ice.",
  "storyline": "Towards the icebreaker \"Mikhail Gromov\" is moving a huge iceberg. Leaving from collision, the ship falls into the ice trap and is forced to drift near the coast of Antarctica. Around it only an ominous silence and a bitter cold. Fuel is running out - Nerves on edge - And even if it would be possible to go, nowhere to go anyway. The crew of the icebreaker is no margin for error. One wrong decision and heavy ice crushed the ship.",
