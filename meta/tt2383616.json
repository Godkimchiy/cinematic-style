  "plot": "Movie 43 is a series of different skits containing different scenes and scenarios.\nThe Pitch\nProduced and directed by Peter Farrelly and written by Rocky Russo, Jeremy Sosenko, and Ricky Blitt\nThe film is composed of multiple comedy shorts presented through an overarching segment titled \"The Pitch\", in which Charlie Wessler (Dennis Quaid), a mad screenwriter, is attempting to pitch a script to film executive Griffin Schraeder (Greg Kinnear). After revealing several of the stories in his script, Wessler becomes agitated when Schraeder dismisses his outrageous ideas, and he pulls a gun on him and forces him to listen to multiple other stories before making Schraeder consult his manager, Bob Mone (Common), to purchase the film. When they do so, Mone's condescending, humiliating attitude toward Schraeder angers him to the point that, after agreeing to make the film \"the biggest film since Howard the Duck\", he confronts Mone in the parking lot with a gun and tries to make him perform fellatio on the security guard (Will Sasso) (Wessler had gotten on the lot by doing the same thing) and kill him if he does not make the film. Wessler tries to calm Schraeder down with more story ideas to no avail, but Mone pulls out a gun and shoots Schraeder to death. The segment ends with it being revealed that it is being shot by a camera crew as part of the movie, leading into the final segments.\nCastDennis Quaid as Charlie WesslerGreg Kinnear as Griffin SchraederCommon as Bob MoneCharlie Saxton as JayWill Sasso as JerryOdessa Rae as DanitaSeth MacFarlane as himselfMike Meldman as himselfAlternative version (The Thread)\nDirected by Steven Brill and written by Rocky Russo and Jeremy Sosenko\nThe structure of the film released in some countries, like the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, differs. Instead of a pitch, the films are connected by a group of three teenagers searching for the most banned film in the world, Movie 43, which will ultimately lead to the destruction of civilization. Calvin Cutler (Mark L. Young) and his friend J.J. (Adam Cagley) make a video in the style of MTV's Jackass and upload it on YouTube where it instantly reaches over 1,000,000 views. This turns out to be an April Fool's prank from Calvin's younger brother Baxter (Devin Eash), who cloned YouTube and hyper-inflated the views while working on his science project. Calvin and J.J. attempt to get revenge. They tell Baxter of a film that's so dangerous it will cause the annihilation of the world. The movie is known as Movie 43. While J.J. and Baxter look for Movie 43 on Google, Calvin retrieves Baxter's laptop and loads it with viruses from porn sites, and masturbates to a strip tease video on the porn sites in a bathroom. Baxter finds hundreds of results for Movie 43 on a website referred to by him as a dark corner of the Internet. They find the sketches starting from the 43rd search on the list of results. As he and J.J. keep watching videos, they are interrupted by a man known as Vrankovich (Fisher Stevens) and a group of Chinese mobsters (Tim Chou and James Hsu) who are tempted to find Movie 43, even going as far as to take J.J.'s classmate Stevie Schraeder (Nate Hartley), film executive Griffin Schraeder's oldest son, hostage. Vrankovich warns them that if they find Movie 43, civilization will be left to ruins. They ignore his claims and keep searching. They eventually find the real, the one and only Movie 43, which turns out to involve Baxter as a profane commando who leads a group of recruits to survive after the world has ended. As Calvin finishes ruining Baxter's laptop, their mother (Beth Littleford) enters, wearing the same shirt and shorts that the woman in the strip tease video wore, causing Calvin to flip out after realizing that he had masturbated to a video of his mother. He also has visions, and finds semen from his erect crotch on his hand causing him to stare at his hand in shock and horror. Afterward, a deadly earthquake rumbles and mankind is lost. However, a few years later the only survivor, a crippled Calvin, finds Baxter's laptop still working despite viral infections. He watches the last remaining skits on the laptop. This version of the film was released in the U.S. as part of the Blu-ray Disc of Movie 43 as an unrated alternate cut of the film.\nCastMark L.

(August 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)The Catch\nProduced and directed by Peter Farrelly and written by Bill O'Malley and Rocky Russo &amp; Jeremy Sosenko\nBeth (Kate Winslet) is a single businesswoman who goes on a blind date with Davis (Hugh Jackman), the city's most eligible bachelor. When the two arrive together at a restaurant, Beth is shocked when he removes his scarf, revealing a pair of testicles dangling from his neck. Over dinner it confuses her that Davis fails to acknowledge his anatomical abnormality, and that nobody seems to be surprised by it. When two friends of Davis (Roy Jenkins and Katie Finneran) come by, one of them convinces him to give Beth a kiss. Davis agrees, but when he kisses her, his neck-testicles are dangling near Beth's mouth, causing her to scream and budge out of the kiss.\nCastHugh Jackman as DavisKate Winslet as BethRoy Jenkins as RayRocky Russo as Waiter JakeAnna Madigan as AbbyJulie Claire as PamKatie Finneran as AngieHomeschooled\nDirected by Will Graham and written by Will Graham &amp; Jack Kukoda\nHaving recently moved, Sean (Alex Cranmer) and Clare (Julie Ann Emery) have coffee with their new neighbors. The neighbors, Robert (Liev Schreiber) and Samantha (Naomi Watts) have a teenage son, Kevin (Jeremy Allen White), whom they have home-schooled. Sean and Clare begin inquiring about the homeschooling, and the numerous manners in which Robert and Samantha have replicated a high school environment within their home, going as far as hazing, bullying, and giving out detentions, are revealed. They also throw high school parties and Samantha instigates Kevin's \"first kiss\" with him. Visibly disturbed, the neighbors end up meeting Kevin, who says he is going out and gives them the impression that all is fine: until he reveals a doll made of a mop with Samantha's face on it, referring to the doll as his girlfriend.\nCastJeremy Allen White as Kevin MillerLiev Schreiber as Robert MillerNaomi Watts as Samantha MillerAlex Cranmer as SeanJulie Ann Emery as ClareThe Proposition\nDirected by Steve Carr and written by Rocky Russo &amp; Jeremy Sosenko\nJulie (Anna Faris) and Doug (Chris Pratt) have been in a relationship for a year. When he attempts to propose to her, she reveals to him that she is a coprophiliac, and asks him to defecate on her in the bedroom. Urged by his best friend Larry (J.B. Smoove) and others to go along with it, he eats a large meal and drinks a bottle of laxative prior to the event. Wanting foreplay, Julie is angered when Doug wants to finish, and she runs into the street. Chasing after her, he is then hit by a car and graphically evacuates his bowels everywhere. She cradles him and apologizes; covered and surrounded by his excrement on the road, she exclaims that it is the \"most beautiful thing\" she has ever seen and accepts his marriage proposal. (In the end credits, Julie and Doug are mistakenly renamed Vanessa and Jason by Rocky Russo, Jeremy Sosenko, Steve Carr, Peter Farrelly, and Charles B. Wessler).\nCastAnna Faris as Julie (aka Vanessa)Chris Pratt as Doug (aka Jason)J. B.

His ex-girlfriend, Veronica (Emma Stone), comes through his line and the two begin arguing, which soon turns into sexual discussion and flirtation as they lament over their relationship; unbeknownst to them, Neil's intercom microphone broadcasts the entire explicit conversation throughout the store, where various elderly people and vagrants tune in. After she leaves in tears, the customers agree to cover his shift while he goes after her.\nCastKieran Culkin as NeilEmma Stone as VeronicaArthur French as Old manBrooke Davis as Tall ladyJosh Shuman as Short maniBabe\nDirected by Steven Brill and written by Claes Kjellstrom &amp; Jonas Wittenmark &amp; Tobias Carlson and Rocky Russo &amp; Jeremy Sosenko\nA developing company is having a meeting in their headquarters over their newly released product, the \"iBabe\", which is a life-sized, realistic replica of a nude woman which functions as an MP3 player. The boss (Richard Gere) listens to his various workers (Kate Bosworth, Aasif Mandvi and Jack McBrayer) argue over the placement of a fan that was built into the genital region of the iBabe, which is dismembering the penises of teenage boys who attempt to have sex with them. The board members then agree to strongly emphasize the dangers of the product via its new commercials.\nCastRichard Gere as BossKate Bosworth as ArleneJack McBrayer as BrianAasif Mandvi as RobertDarby Lynn Totten as WomanMarc Ambrose as ChappyCathy Cliften as iBabe #1Cherina Monteniques Scott as iBabe #2Zach Lasry as BoySuperhero Speed Dating\nCo-edited and directed by James Duffy and written by Will Carlough\nRobin (Justin Long) and his cohort Batman (Jason Sudeikis) are in Gotham City at a speed dating establishment seeking out a bomb threat by their nemesis, Penguin (John Hodgman). While Robin attempts to connect with various women through speed dating including Lois Lane (Uma Thurman) and Supergirl (Kristen Bell), Batman encounters his ex Wonder Woman (Leslie Bibb) and attempts to stop Penguin from detonating Supergirl, who later turns out to be the Riddler (Will Carlough) in disguise, which Batman already knew and was screwing with Robin, who kissed \"her\" moments before unveiling.\nCastJustin Long as RobinJason Sudeikis as BatmanUma Thurman as Lois LaneBobby Cannavale as SupermanKristen Bell as SupergirlJohn Hodgman as The PenguinLeslie Bibb as Wonder WomanWill Carlough as RiddlerKatrina Bowden as StaceyMachine Kids\nWritten, co-edited, and directed by Jonathan van Tulleken\nA faux-Public service announcement about children stuck in machines and how adults' criticism of these particular machines affect the feelings of the children stuck inside the machines.

When they begin to kiss, his older brother Mikey (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) enters the living room and makes fun of them. Amanda then discovers she is menstruating and tries to hide it, and when Nathan sees blood on her pants, he panics and believes her to be bleeding to death, causing a debacle, which would later have Nathan and Mikey's father Steve (Patrick Warburton) and Amanda's father (Matt Walsh) involved. Amanda calls them out on their stupidity and feels embarrassed to know that she's getting her first period in front of them and they don't know what to do about it. When she leaves with her father, Nathan yells that the process of keeping the lining of her internal organs intact by inserting his erect phallus into her vagina is much too complicated and Mikey agrees. Steve cheers them up by farting in front of them. As Mikey goes to the bathroom, Nathan and Steve watch a game on television, which has a very graphic Tampax commercial in which a girl gets eaten by a shark due to her menstruating.\nCastChristopher Mintz-Plasse as MikeyChlo\u00eb Grace Moretz as AmandaJimmy Bennett as NathanPatrick Warburton as Steve (Nathan and Mikey's father)Matt Walsh as Amanda's fatherTampax\nDirected by Patrik Forsberg and written by Patrik Forsberg &amp; Olle Sarri\nAnother faux-commercial involving two women who go swimming in the sea.

When he arrives, Brian and Pete are shot at but ultimately kill both leprechauns. At the end of the segment, Pete reveals he has also caught a fairy (Esti Ginzburg) who performs fellatio for gold coins.\nCastGerard Butler as Leprechaun #1, Leprechaun #2Johnny Knoxville as PeteSeann William Scott as BrianEsti Ginzburg as Storybook fairyTruth or Dare\nProduced and directed by Peter Farrelly and written by Greg Pritikin\nDonald (Stephen Merchant) and Emily (Halle Berry) are on a date together at a Mexican restaurant. Tired of typical first dates, Emily challenges Donald to a game of truth or dare. She dares him to grab a man\u2019s buttocks, and he follows with daring her to blow out the birthday candles on a blind boy\u2019s cake. The game rapidly escalates to extremes, in which both of them get plastic surgery and tattoos, and humiliate themselves. When Donald and Emily arrive back at Emily's apartment, they praise their date. Donald tries to kiss her, but she rejects him, claiming she's not attracted to Asian men (which he was surgically altered to resemble). It is revealed that she was joking and invites him to have sex with her as she shows him her enlarged breasts.\nCastHalle Berry as EmilyStephen Merchant as DonaldSayed Badreya as Large manSnooki as HerselfCaryl West as WaitressRicki Noel Lander as Nurse ElizabethPaloma Felisberto as Bachelorette party girlJasper Grey as PatronBenny Harris as Blanco the bartenderZen Gesner as StripperVictory\u2019s Glory\nDirected by Rusty Cundieff and written by Rocky Russo &amp; Jeremy Sosenko\nSet in 1959, Coach Jackson (Terrence Howard) is lecturing his all-black basketball team before their first game against an all-white team.

Beezel seems to detest Amy and anyone who comes between him and Anson, but Anson only sees Beezel as innocent. One day, Amy witnesses Beezel masturbating to summer vacation photos of Anson in a swimsuit. Beezel attacks her and violently urinates on her. Anson still finds his pet innocent but Amy threatens to leave if he doesn't get rid of Beezel. Caring more about his relationship, Anson agrees to find a new home for him. That night, from a closet, Beezel tearfully watches the couple make love (whilst sodomizing himself with a hairbrush and dry humping a stuffed teddy bear). The next day when it comes time to take Beezel away, he is nowhere to be found. Amy goes outside to look. Beezel then runs her over with a truck and attempts to shoot her to death with a shotgun, but she chases him into the street and begins beating him with a shovel, which is witnessed by a group of children attending a birthday party at a neighboring house. When Anson approaches to see what is happening, Amy tries to explain Beezel\u2019s motives. Beezel acts innocent and Anson sides with his cat. The children of the party then attack and murder Amy for beating up Beezel, stabbing her with plastic forks. Anson grabs Beezel, as Beezel again fantasizes about French kissing his owner.\nCastElizabeth Banks as AmyJosh Duhamel as AnsonEmily Alyn Lind as Birthday girlMichelle Gunn as MommyChristina Linhardt as Party clownFind Our Daughter\nWritten and directed by Bob Odenkirk\nIn this segment that was cut from the film, Maude (Julianne Moore) and George (Tony Shalhoub) are looking for their breast-flashing daughter Susie (Jordanna Taylor) with the help of the private eye (Bob Odenkirk), who is behind the camera with only one clue which is a small video that features their daughter.
