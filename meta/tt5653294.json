  "overview": "A story about bravery, self-sacrifice and human dignity put on trial by the merciless power of nature. A young pilot is fired from military air force after disobeying an absurd order. He gets a job as a co-pilot with a civil airline. Being brutally honest and direct, he is not on best terms with his new colleagues. During a flight to Asia his crew receives a distress message from a volcanic island and makes a decision to attempt a rescue mission. Will it be a success? Will they survive the disaster? They have a single chance to find that out: by being a team and sticking up for one another.",

  "plot": "Talented young pilot Alexey Gushchin does not accept authority and acts in accordance with a personal code of honor. For failure to comply with an absurd order, he is prevented from flying a military aircraft again and in spite of that, he refuses to ask his father (famous aircraft engineer) for help getting back on the scene. He applies to a passenger airline and displays remarkable flying talent, landing a chance as an intern. Alexey becomes the second pilot-trainee on the Tu-204SM under the guidance of an experienced crew commander, the pilot Leonid Zinchenko. Their work relationship is not easy, but due to Alexey's talent, Leonid chooses to keep him at his side, even after more cases of insubordination (again, failure to comply with absurd orders).\n\nDuring the flight to Southeast Asia, the crew receives a message about an earthquake on one of the Aleutian Islands and decides to go to the epicenter of the disaster to evacuate people before the expected volcano eruption. Together, the two pilots manage to escape the island on two planes, however, the smaller cargo plane has not enough fuel. Using a risky maneuver, the crew manages to transfer passengers via sky line between the two vessels in air moments before the cargo plane would run out of fuel and crash into the ocean. After the rough, but successful landing in lightning storm the two are terminated from their positions as pilots (as they both disobeyed a direct order), and are transferred to Aeroflot as flight interns.",
