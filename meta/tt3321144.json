  "storyline": "Anna is nervous when she and her son, Tomas, arrive in the small, close-knit community of Igloolik, in the Canadian Arctic. Anna had a short-lived affair with Tomas's Inuk father when she worked in Igloolik. But Tomas, now 14 years old, was born and raised in his mother's native city of Montreal and never knew much about his origins. Tomas is bright, strong and curious about his father's culture, but his father is no longer around to show him the way. For his mother and Inuit family, the joy of homecoming is mixed with memories of a brief and painful chapter in their shared history. Over the course of two weeks that seem to blend into one long day under the midnight sun, Anna and Thomas strive to rebuild the family they could no longer ignore.",
