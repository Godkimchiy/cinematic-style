  "overview": "Based on true events, \u201dAn Unheard Woman\u201d tells the story of a Bavarian \u201cErin Brockovich\u201d, who, to save her daughter\u2019s life, even takes on the Bavarian government.  Magdalena, the 9-years old daughter of bavarian farmer Hanni, suffers from a mysterious disease. First she stops growing, then slowly loses her eyesight. Hanni starts a nearly hopeless fight. At night she studies medical literature, at day she takes care of the farm. Additionally to that, she always also fights her personal demons from her youth and finally even risks her livelihood when she tangles with a powerful opponent in court hearings.",
  "storyline": "Farmer Hanni (Rosalie Thomass) is desperate. Her daughter Magdalena (Romy Butz) complains of illness symptoms, but no one can determine what the child is missing. Most doctors think the girl is a simulant. In her search for a doctor who can finally interpret the symptoms, Hanni is increasingly neglecting her husband (Florian Karlheim) and her two older sons, which her mother-in-law (Gisela Schneeberger) uses to incite the family against her. But Hanni goes on her way, even rolls medical literature herself, and finally meets the endocrinologist Dr. Espach (Sylvana Krappatsch), who can help her. But with a diagnosis and a possible operation with a specialist in New York for Hanni the fight is not yet over. She goes to Munich's district court to take responsibility for all the doctors who have not believed her daughter's complaints.",
