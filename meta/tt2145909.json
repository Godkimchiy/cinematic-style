Eventually Tommy &amp; Carmen break in and find the next door flat empty. But the hauntings only escalate and when Mark is injured and taken into hospital, Tommy finds himself alone on the estate. He realises he\u2019s in way over his head. What does the malign force want\u2026? The truth is more terrifying than Tommy could imagine.
