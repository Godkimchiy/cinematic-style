  "overview": "Too shy to make a proper introduction, a recent college grad devises to shoot a documentary about the NYC nightlife scene in order to meet the go-go guy he\u2019s cyber-obsessed with.",
  "storyline": "College boy \"Doc\" is obsessed with a well-known NYC go-go dancer, nicknamed \"Go.\" He befriends his hunky crush under the ruse of shooting a movie about what it's like to live in his skin. Camera in hand, he follows his subject across the city - into bars, onto rooftops, over dance floors and, ultimately, into his bedroom - but as they grow closer, flirtation blurs the line between subject and filmmaker until a steamy night together solidifies deeper feelings. Cory Kruekeberg's explicit directorial debut explores the thrill and danger of getting exactly what you wish for.",
