  "storyline": "The grand old mansions of Kolkata are being razed to the ground to make way for swanky condominiums, malls and multiplexes. Some of these dilapidated 'disputed' buildings were haunted by ghosts who had taken shelter there over centuries. They were evicted and are homeless today. There is no 'rehabilitation package' on offer. Politicians, media, intellectuals, civic society - no one gives a damn. After all , ghosts can't vote. Chowdhuribari is one such heritage property which is rented out for film shoots to facilitate its maintenance. A heroine faints during a shooting, allegedly sighting a ghost in a mirror. A filmmaker on a reconnaissance trip to the building gets to hear of a spooky story revolving around the house. But is it just a tall tale or is there a twist in the 'tail'? Song & dance, drama, romance, action and even an item number, BHOOTER BHOBISHYOT has all the Filmi Masala as well as some food for thought.",
