  "plot": "Main article: List of Bakuman characters\nThe plot begins when Moritaka Mashiro, a junior high student, forgets his notebook in class. His classmate, Akito Takagi, notes Mashiro's drawings in it and asks him to become a manga artist to his stories. Mashiro declines, citing his late manga artist uncle, who died from overworking. Takagi incites Mashiro to meet with Miho Azuki, Mashiro's crush, and tells her the two plan to become manga artists. In response, Azuki reveals her plans to be a voice actress. Mashiro proposes to her that they should both marry when Azuki becomes a voice actress for the anime adaptation of their manga. She accepts, but under the condition that they not meet face-to-face again until then. The two then start creating their manga, under the pen name Muto Ashirogi, in hopes of getting serialized in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump.\n\nAfter submitting many one-shots to Shueisha, Ashirogi begin with their first published series in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump, Detective Trap (\u7591\u63a2\u5075TRAP\uff08\u304e\u305f\u3093\u3066\u3044\u30c8\u30e9\u30c3\u30d7\uff09, Gitantei Torappu?), which is eventually canceled due to its declining popularity, after Mashiro is hospitalized for overworking on the manga. Their next series is the gag manga Vroom, Tanto Daihatsu (\u8d70\u308c!\u5927\u767a\u30bf\u30f3\u30c8, Hashire! Daihatsu Tanto?), which they give up on, realizing it will never be popular. After being challenged by the editor-in-chief of Jump to create a superior manga to their rival's, Ashirogi develops their current series Perfect Crime Party (PCP -\u5b8c\u5168\u72af\u7f6a\u515a-, PCP -Kanzen Hanzait\u014d-?). It is met with considerable popularity but due to its theme, is unfit for an anime series. When their rival, Eiji Nizuma, submits a one-shot for serialization, Ashirogi competes by submitting Reversi which replaces Perfect Crime Party while the latter is moved to Shueisha's fictional monthly magazine, Hisshou Jump. After many conflicts involving the graphic novel sales and the voice actress choice, Reversi is chosen for an anime adaptation with Miho as the primary actress, after she passes a public audition. After fulfilling their dreams, the series ends with Mashiro officially proposing to Miho at the place they made their promise, followed by their first kiss.",
