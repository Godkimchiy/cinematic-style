  "overview": "In the late 1970's, the SETI project received a one time signal from outer space. It looked exactly as theorists thought a communication from an alien civilization would -- unfortunately it has never been decoded. Or so we were told. Unbeknownst to the general public the signal was translated and told us two things:  1) We are not alone.  2) The galaxy is a dangerous place.",
  "storyline": "After thousands of years of thinking we are alone in the universe we decode a message (in the 60s) telling us we are not alone, and that the universe is a dangerous place and that we are going to be attacked. Luckily, the coded message came from a friendly alien race that fathered and protected us over the years. And now they are giving us the tools to fight back (in the form of power armor). But the delivery service takes a long time, and during those loooong decades waiting for that cargo ship to arrive with their one power suit, they choose a champion of earth to train to wear the suit and defend the earth! Then the ship finally arrives... Only to get shot down by 4 morons who play with the suit and ultimately get one piece each stuck to them. Now they need to work with the government to train these 4 morons with individual pieces attached to them. Will they save the day or will they stand around contemplating life?",
  "plot": "The suit of power on display.\nIn 1977, the government has secretly decoded a transmission, sent by the alien Antareans, which says that a deadly race known as the Worg are coming to destroy Earth. To help defend Earth, the Antareans have sent a powerful battle suit for the \"Champion of Earth\" to wear. The government begins training Adam from birth to be the Champion. Thirty-eight years later, Officer Anthony Hagan is called to a party where Zachary \"Zach\" Spencer is causing trouble and where he runs into his daughter and Zach's girlfriend, Mindy. After tasing Zach, Hagan drives him away, only to find Woodrow \"Woody\" Johnson and Herman Mendoza shooting unauthorized fireworks. Herman defiantly launches a massive rocket. The firework strikes an incoming UFO and causes it to crash nearby.\n\nThe UFO opens to reveal the battle suit, and the four men each take a piece of it. The suit activates when all four pieces are worn, and each piece becomes irreversibly attached and genetically locked to its wearer. Zach discovers that his arm-cannon can shoot energy projectiles, Hagan's gauntlet can create an energy field, Woody's helmet increases his intelligence over time and has a host of other functions, and Herman's boots can make him run at superhuman speeds. The UFO displays a holographic recording by an Antarean, warning them of an impending war. The military shows up and apprehends the group. Angry that their preparations have been jeopardized and that Zach has posted a selfie with the suit (calling the four \"Lazer Team\"), Colonel Emory gives Adam orders to train them in only four days, after which time the Worg are scheduled to arrive. As expected, the training goes horribly. Meanwhile, a group of soldiers are possessed by small robotic insects sent by the Worg, and begins to hunt down Lazer Team with advanced handheld weapons. They show up at Hagan's house and possess Mindy.\n\nThe officers in charge decide to try and amputate the suit from the team, and Woody overhears with augmented hearing. They are brought to a hospital under the pretext that they are receiving physicals, but escape using the suit's abilities. They are intercepted by Adam, but they work together to create a strong energy shield, and Zach knocks Adam unconscious. They escape the facility and hide out in Hagan's ex-wife's cabin. Zach calls the Worg-controlled Mindy on Skype and gives her his location. She arrives and attacks Zach and the others, but they subdue her and Woody communicates with the Worg through the device on the back of her neck. Before they can finish negotiating, Zach rips the device off and it self-destructs, destroying the cabin. They are pursued by the possessed soldiers, but manage to escape and kill one of them in the process.\n\nThey make their way to Zach and Mindy's high school, where they find out that an Antarean ship has landed over the town's football field, creating a giant forcefield around it. The Worg transmit a message, calling the Champions of Earth to battle. Lazer Team is once again ambushed by the possessed soldiers, but uses teamwork to kill the remaining three. With the pressure of saving the planet weighing down on them, they all decide to hide except for Hagan, who turns himself in to the military. However, seeing the full potential in the team, Adam frees Hagan and they sneak to the stadium where a crowd has formed around the UFO. They find the rest of the team there and regroup. They hijack a police car and ram it into the forcefield, successfully reaching the football field.\n\nThe Worg warrior arrives in an identical suit of armor, and a crowd of holographic Antareans watches from the stands. Woody intercepts a transmission from the ship, revealing that rather than a war they are part of an elimination tournament where the Antareans destroy the losers' planets until one remains. Lazer Team proves unsuccessful at defeating the Worg by themselves, so Adam begins a distraction using riot gear from the police car. Adam sacrifices himself by letting the Worg destroy him with a dark-matter cannon, indirectly teaching the team how to achieve this with the suit. Lazer Team and the Worg fire dark matter beams into each other, creating a vortex at midfield. The four separated suit pieces malfunction and Lazer Team is blown clear of the forcefield, but the Worg and the Antarean ship are consumed.\n\nThe team is greeted by a huge crowd outside. Emory arrives and states that the war isn't over, and that Lazer Team is going into space.",
