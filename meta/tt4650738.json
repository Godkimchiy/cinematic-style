  "overview": "After a night of partying, Vicente is involved in a hit-and-run that kills a man. Vicente claims his innocence, but he was drunk and high. A tangled web of lies buries the truth, making a social scandal disappear \u2014 exonerating the real culprit, the son of a powerful politician.",
  "storyline": "Vicente recently got back to Chile after living in LA. He's now on vacation from a school full of people he can't relate to. He is young, reckless and kind of a loner. Spending summer at his parents' beach house in Chile, its days of lying on the sand, swimming and partying - with whoever. But one of those random nights of chasing girls and downing cups of booze changes his life forever. He becomes the main suspect of a hit-and-run incident that caused the death of a local fisherman. \"I wasn't the one driving,\" he says, but his memories are a blur. He was in the car. He was wasted. And the driver he recalls happens to be the son of a powerful politician. His case, is not an easy one. Slowly but steadily, power, manipulation and guilt will unravel, precipitating Vicente into a downward spiral that brings his sweet summer vacations to a bitter end.",
