  "plot": "This article needs an improved plot summary. (October 2015)\nWhen a flying saucer reportedly lands in rural Iowa, The Old Man (who runs a secret branch of the CIA), decides to investigate. He goes in person, accompanied by agents Sam (who is the son of The Old Man) and Jarvis, as well as Dr Mary Sefton, a NASA specialist in alien biology. They find that aliens have indeed landed and are planning to use their mind-control powers to take over our planet. The aliens are slug-like creatures, and they are attaching themselves to people\u2019s backs, taking control of their victims\u2019 nervous systems, and manipulating those people as puppets.\n\nThe slugs spread steadily, and soon attack one of the agents, Sam. Controlling Sam, aliens almost get the president possessed too, but are defeated by the agents. Agents then learn they can remove a slug by an electric shock, and free Sam from the possession of a slug. It is soon found out all slugs share a common conscience, a sort of a group mind.\n\nThe aliens quickly reproduce by division, soon controlling not only most of the population of the infested area, but also military personnel sent to the area to fight them.\n\nAs agents learn where the aliens\u2019 \u2018hive\u2019 is located, they attempt to sneak in, and release Mary, whom aliens captured earlier. Together, they find survived people whom slugs couldn\u2019t possess. They take one of them, a boy, with them, leaving the hive.\n\nIt is soon found out the boy suffered from encephalitis in the past, and that apparently was the reason a slug couldn\u2019t possess him. A biological warfare is adopted, and seemingly all parasites die. During a later inspection of a hive, The Old Man is attacked by the last healthy slug. In a fight on a helicopter, Sam destroys the parasite attached to the body of his father.",
