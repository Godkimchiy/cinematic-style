  "overview": "The USA is in the grips of a rancorous partisanship the like of which has not been seen in nearly a century. Every political issue today invariably becomes a pitched partisan battle, irrespective of the issue - be it the economy, global climate change, education or foreign policy. The two parties are further apart than they have been in generations and this extreme polarization has made it nearly impossible to govern the country effectively.  How has the United States become so divided?  SPLIT journeys from coast to coast to find an answer to that question at a time when it is needed most.",
  "storyline": "\"Split: A Deeper Divide\" is a riveting investigation into the partisanship paralyzing our politics, going beyond the bitter rancor to reveal the truth of why our country is more polarized and our politics more gridlocked than at any other time in recent memory. Featuring interviews with some of the most insightful and recognizable names in politics today, including Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN), Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE), Lawrence Lessig (Foundation of Ethics; Harvard), Grover Norquist (Americans for Tax Reform), Ezra Klein (MSNBC), Robert Kaiser (Washington Post), Thomas Frank (Wall Street Journal), Noam Chomsky (MIT), Nicholas Kristof (NY Times), Tucker Carlson (Fox News), Amy Goodman (Democracy Now), and more, this thought-provoking documentary unpacks the partisan wedges that have been driven ever deeper into our national fabric to show the devastating impact these have had on our democracy.",
