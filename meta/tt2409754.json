  "overview": "Honza Marak has long since abandoned a career in IT and has bought a cottage on the outskirts of a small village, where he\u2019s settled in with his wife Marketa, daughter Anyna and son Sayen. He works in the woods as a forest labourer repairing roads and enclosures, cutting wood to sell and assisting the foresters. Marketa earns a living as a masseuse and alternative healer, making use of various mind-altering plants and mushrooms, which leads to conflict with the old inhabitants and eventually with drug enforcement. Daughter Anyna attends a distant school where her grades deteriorate as she wanders the woods learning from nature rather than from her textbooks.",
  "storyline": "To the Woods is a sequel to Vorel's successful Out of the City (2000). Having abandoned city life long ago, the Marak's live in a quaint cottage on the outskirts of a small rural village. Honza earns a very modest living as a forest laborer, while his wife Marketa works as a masseuse and alternative healer. Anyna, their nymph-like, pubescent daughter, explores the verdant landscape by night, communicating with the stags that still make the endangered woodland their home. It is in these wanderings that Anyna makes the acquaintance of locally born-and-bred forest ranger and hunter, Ludva. Meanwhile her parents are persecuted by local authorities, with her mother being taken into custody for her popular magic mushroom s\u00e9ance. As their financial situation becomes increasingly dire, a solution emerges following an unexpected life change.",
