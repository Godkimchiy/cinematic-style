  "synopsis": "The Pit and the Pendulum - A medical test subject wakes to find himself alone in a white-walled room. A black hole opens mysteriously in the floor, which heightens the man's paranoia. When the man hallucinates a creature emerging from the pit, he begins clawing out his own eyes from fear.Alone - \"Pepper Face\" torments a captive victim inside a warehouse. When the man regains consciousness following his torture, he escapes to another room where he discovers his wife Sara tied to a table with all of her limbs severed.

At this point, the man discovers that he is being monitored and he is next seen being placed behind bars.Loss of Breath - Shortly after his agent Giovanni informs him that mainstream casting directors do not take him seriously, self-absorbed porno actor Francesco Falcon experiences a strange shortness of breath during a sexual escapade. On the orders of his rival Manero, two thugs capture and castrate Francesco. Francesco breaks free and kills his captors before recovering his severed penis. Francesco's body is later found hanged from suicide and buried in a mausoleum. However, because his loss of breath prevents him from suffocating, Francesco does not die. Instead, he secretly escapes the vault with a hidden stash of money while the world presumes he is dead.Morgue Street - An apelike creature breaks into a flat and rapes two prostitutes before its master returns to chain the beast. The surviving prostitute slashes the man's throat with a razorblade and the monster grieves over its master's death.The Tell-Tale Heart - A homeless derelict struggles to reform his wayward life.The System of Dr. Tarr & Prof. Fether - Elbasani, Albania - 1977: A researcher arrives at a mental asylum to learn more about the methods employed at the institute.

The man eventually ends up committed as a tarred and feathered patient in the asylum now run by the inmates.The Premature Burial - Buried alive in a wooden coffin, a frantic man finally claws his way to freedom. Upon returning to the surface, he finds himself in a world where the dead are returning to life, as he himself has seemingly done."
