  "plot": "The story is of a modern society endangered by power and greed and the rebellion of the \"little people\" against corrupt and soulless authority.\n\nA group of four prominent men \u2013 The General (Paul Henreid), The Commissar (Oskar Homolka), The Chairman (Yul Brynner) and The Prospector (Donald Pleasence) \u2013 discuss how they can increase their fortunes. The Prospector tells them that there is oil in the middle of Paris and they resolve to acquire the rights with or without the consent of the people of Paris. Countess Aurelia (Katharine Hepburn), the \"madwoman\" of the title, learns of this plan to drill for oil under the very streets of her district from Roderick (Richard Chamberlain) -an activist-, and The Ragpicker (Danny Kaye). She enlists the help of her friends, a motley crew of \"little people\" who include, Constance (Margaret Leighton) and Gabrielle (Giulietta Masina). A trial takes place in the Countess's cellar presided over by Aurelia's friend Josephine (Edith Evans) as judge and the Ragpicker as the lawyer for the defense.",
