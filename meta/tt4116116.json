  "overview": "Guibord is an independent Member of Parliament who represents Prescott-Makadew\u00e0-Rapides-aux Outardes, a vast county in Northern Quebec. As the entire country watches, Guibord unwillingly finds himself in the awkward position of holding the decisive vote to determine whether Canada will go to war. Accompanied by his wife, his daughter and an idealistic intern from Haiti named Sovereign, Guibord travels across his district in order to consult his constituents. While groups of lobbyists get involved in a debate that spins out of control, the MP will have to face his own conscience. 'My Internship in Canada' is a biting political satire in which politicians, citizens and lobbyists go head-to-head tearing democracy to shreds.  Film starring Suzanne Cl\u00e9ment, Patrick Huard and Mardy Men",
  "storyline": "Earnest twenty-two year old Souverain Pascal, a student of democracy and a recent arrival to Canada from his native Port-au-Prince, Haiti, is able to secure an internship with the only Canadian Member of Parliament (MP) who responded to his request for work, Steve Guibord of the northern, sprawling and largely rural Qu\u00e9bec riding of Prescott - Makedew\u00e1 - Rapides-aux-Outardes, he the only sitting Independent in what is now the Conservative Party majority Parliament, albeit a majority with the slimmest of margins. Steve's situation, with no party backing, makes him arguably the most ignored MP in the House, with his constituency office above a lingerie shop, which is only accessible through that shop, a manifestation of what little resources he has to conduct his political work. A former NHL hockey player, Steve left it as a career for personal reasons that would have made the required travel untenable. He also left the Liberal Party on bad terms in not agreeing with their aboriginal ...",
  "plot": "The film stars Patrick Huard as Steve Guibord, an independent Member of Parliament from northern Quebec who quite unexpectedly finds himself in the position of holding the tie-breaking vote on whether Canada will go to war in the Middle East. Embarking on a tour of his constituency to evaluate public opinion, various lobby groups spin the debate farther and farther out of control and Guibord's confusion ultimately forces the decision onto Souverain (Irdens Exantus), his Haitian immigrant intern.",
