  "storyline": "A cop and his son have to put away their differences while undercover on a therapeutic trip.",
  "plot": "Tom Ripley is a young man struggling to make a living in 1950s New York City. While working at a party, he is approached by the wealthy shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf, who believes that Ripley went to Princeton with his son, Dickie. Greenleaf recruits Ripley to travel to Italy to persuade Dickie to return home to the United States, for which he will pay Ripley $1,000. Ripley accepts the proposal, although he did not go to Princeton and has never even met Dickie.\n\nShortly after his arrival in Italy, Ripley concocts an accidental meeting on the beach with Dickie and his fianc\u00e9e, Marge Sherwood, and quickly insinuates himself into their lives under the pretext of being a fellow jazz lover. On one of their jaunts, Dickie and Ripley meet Dickie's friend Freddie Miles, who treats Ripley with barely concealed contempt.\n\nA local girl, whom Dickie had impregnated, drowns herself when he refuses to help her financially. Ripley secretly witnesses their final encounter. Dickie begins to tire of Ripley, resenting his constant presence and suffocating dependence. Ripley's own feelings are complicated by his desire to maintain the opulent lifestyle Dickie has afforded him, and by his growing sexual obsession with his new friend. As a gesture, Dickie invites Ripley to sail with him for a last trip to San Remo. Whilst out to sea together, Dickie lashes out when Ripley confronts him about his behavior, and a fight ensues during which Ripley repeatedly strikes Dickie with an oar, killing him. To conceal the murder, Ripley scuttles the boat with Dickie's body before swimming ashore.\n\nWhen the hotel concierge mistakes him for Dickie, Ripley realizes he can assume Dickie's identity. He forges Dickie's signature, modifies his passport and begins living off the allowance provided by Herbert Greenleaf. He uses Dickie's typewriter to communicate with Marge, making her believe that Dickie has deserted her. He checks into two separate hotels as himself and as Dickie, passing messages between them via the hotel staff to provide the illusion that Dickie is still alive.\n\nRipley rents an expensive apartment in Rome and spends a lonely Christmas buying expensive presents for himself. Freddie visits expecting to find Dickie and is immediately suspicious of Ripley, as the apartment is not furnished in Dickie's style, while Ripley appears to have copied Dickie's dress and manner perfectly. On his way out, Freddie meets the landlady, who refers to Ripley as \"Signor Greenleaf\". Freddie goes back to confront him, but Ripley ambushes and murders him, then disposes of the body.\n\nAs a result, Ripley's existence becomes a cat-and-mouse game with the Italian police and Dickie's friends. His predicament is complicated by the presence of Meredith Logue, an heiress he met upon his arrival in Italy and to whom he had introduced himself as Dickie. Ripley clears himself by forging a suicide note addressed to Ripley in Dickie's name and moves to Venice. Marge suspects Ripley's involvement in Dickie's death and confronts him after finding Dickie's rings in Ripley's apartment. Ripley is about to murder her but is interrupted by a mutual friend, Peter Smith-Kingsley, who enters the apartment.\n\nThough gaining the trust of Dickie's father, Ripley is disquieted when Greenleaf hires American private detective Alvin MacCarron to carry out a thorough check. However, MacCarron reveals to Ripley that Greenleaf has ordered the investigation be dropped and intends giving Ripley a substantial portion of Dickie's income, with the understanding that certain sordid details about his son's past not be revealed. Marge is dismayed at the resolution, again accusing Ripley before being taken away by Greenleaf and MacCarron.\n\nRipley goes on a cruise with Peter, only to discover that Meredith is also on board. Ripley secretly placates her with a kiss, but Peter notices. Ripley realizes he cannot keep Peter from discovering that he has been passing himself off as Dickie, because Peter and Meredith know each other and would certainly be meeting on the cruise. He cannot solve this dilemma by murdering Meredith, because she is accompanied by her family. Going to Peter's cabin, Ripley sobs as he strangles Peter to death before returning to his own cabin.",
