  "overview": "In 1870s America, a peaceful American settler kills his family's murderer which unleashes the fury of a notorious gang leader. His cowardly fellow townspeople then betray him, forcing him to hunt down the outlaws alone.",
  "storyline": "The American West in the 1870s. A European settler, Jon Jensen (Mads Mikkelsen), has just welcomed his wife and son to the country when they are kidnapped and murdered. He takes revenge on the murderers, only to discover that one was the brother of a local land baron, Henry Delarue. Delarue runs the local town with a brutal hand. Now he wants vengeance on the man who killed his brother and the local townspeople are too scared of him to stand up to him. Jon is fighting more than just the local thugs, he is facing the entire town.",
  "plot": "Jon and his brother Peter participate in the Second Schleswig War in 1864 and following the defeat of the Danish Realm, they migrate to the United States and settle somewhere between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains. Seven years later, Jon\u2019s wife, Marie and his ten-year-old son, Kresten arrive. The family boards a stagecoach bound for their small residence while Peter stays behind. Their coach is also boarded by two recently released criminals, Paul and Lester. Following a tense struggle, the two criminals throw Jon out of the moving coach after which they rape and kill Jon's wife. They also kill his son and the stagecoach drivers.\n\nWith great effort, Jon catches up to the coach to find his family murdered. Enraged, he in turn kills the two convicts. Unbeknown to him, Paul is the brother of Henry Delarue, a notorious gang leader and land baron. In response, Delarue kills three innocent citizens of Black Creek, the town that reports the deaths to him. He also forces the townspeople to cooperate and find his brother's killer.\n\nAfter burying his wife and son, Jon decides to leave the town with Peter and sells his land to Keane, Black Creek's mayor and undertaker. Before they can leave, Jon and Peter are captured by the town Sheriff, Mallick. As Jon sits in his cell, Mallick tells him that his death will buy the town more time while he tries to alert higher authorities of Delarue's actions. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Delarue is working with the Standard Atlantic Oil Company and with the help of Mayor Keane, had been acquiring Black Creek and its surrounding land, which was close to an untapped oil reserve. Delarue's now widowed sister-in-law Madelaine acts as his accountant and suffers sexual and physical abuse from him.\n\nThe next morning, Jon is escorted to Delarue's base, an abandoned town. He is tied to a post and left in the sun. In Black Creek, Peter breaks out of prison and follows Jon. At night, Peter kills several of Delarue's henchmen, cuts Jon free, and they ride off while being pursued by Delarue and his men. Realizing that Jon is too weak to carry on, Peter leaves Jon hidden and leads the gang away, and is pursued and killed. Taking advantage of Delarue's absence, Madelaine steals his cash and boards a train. However, the train is intercepted and she is captured. Delarue tells his men to kill Madelaine after they are done raping her.\n\nJon roams the countryside, looking for water and shelter. He stumbles across a small residence, belonging to Mrs. Whistler, whose husband was killed by Delarue. Jon takes shelter in her house to recover from his wounds, while Mrs. Whisler and her children flee Black Creek. After returning to town, he confronts and kills Mayor Keane for his deception. At the general store, he arms himself and reluctantly accepts the help of Voichek, the young storekeeper whose grandmother was killed by Delarue.\n\nJon uses diversions and guerrilla tactics to kill Delarue's henchmen one at a time. Voichek is killed and inadvertently sets fire to the hotel where Madelaine is being held, enabling her to escape. Delarue finds and wounds Jon. Just as he is about to kill Jon, Madelaine shoots him twice, and Jon kills him with a shot to the head.\n\nSheriff Mallick and his men arrive to thank Jon. When they try to arrest Madelaine, Jon orders them to leave and states that he will be taking her with him. They leave to start their new life together and the film then reveals that the land is ultimately taken over by the oil company, with several functioning oil wells.",
