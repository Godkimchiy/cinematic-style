  "plot": "In 2013, alien monsters called Kaiju emerge from an interdimensional portal called \u201cThe Breach\u201d at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. Over the course of 2 years, the kaiju wreak havoc upon coastal cities along the ring of fire, such as San Francisco, Sydney, Manila and Hong Kong. Humanity responds by constructing giant mecha called Jaegers, to combat the alien threat. Each Jaeger is co-piloted by two or more people, who share a mental link via a process called \u201cDrifting\u201d to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.\n\nIn 2020, Gipsy Danger, piloted by brothers Raleigh and Yancy Becket, defends Anchorage from a Kaiju named Knifehead. They leave their post, disobeying orders from Marshal Stacker Pentecost, in order to rescue a fishing boat, only for the Kaiju to ambush them, wrecking the Jaeger and killing Yancy. Raleigh manages to pilot Gipsy Danger alone, killing Knifehead, but quits the Jaeger Program. Several years later, the world governments decide to end funding for the continuous construction of Jaegers in favour of anti-Kaiju coastal walls, since Kaiju are appearing more frequently and Jaegers are being destroyed faster then they are built. The remaining Jaegers are relocated to Hong Kong under Pentecost\u2019s command, who plans to destroy the Breach using a tactical nuclear weapon.\n\nPentecost tracks down Raleigh to a wall construction site to recruit him for the assault, though Raleigh still remains traumatised by Yancy\u2019s death. Travelling to the Hong Kong base, the Shatterdome, Raleigh is introduced to Mako Mori, the director of the Jaeger\u2019s restoration program and Pentecost\u2019s adoptive daughter. Four Jaegers remain in operation \u2013 the refurbished Gipsy Danger, the Russian Cherno Alpha, Chinese Crimson Typhoon, and the Australian Striker Eureka, piloted by father and son Herc and Chuck Hansen. To find a new co-pilot, Raleigh participates in tryouts, deciding Mako is \u201cdrift-compatible\u201d. During their first test, Raleigh falls out of alignment reliving Yancy\u2019s death, causing Mako to become lost in the memory of the Kaiju attack on Tokyo that orphaned her, nearly firing Gipsy\u2019s energy cannon. Pentecost grounds both pilots.\n\nPentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Herman Gottlieb. Hermann claims the Breach will stabilise and the Kaiju will increase in number, but it will allow the assault to succeed, while Newton suggests attempting to drift with a Kaiju\u2019s brain to learn more about them, but is dismissed by his colleagues. Newton attempts it regardless, discovering Kaiju are bioweapons grown by alien colonists. Pentecost instructs Newton to find black market dealer Hannibal Chau to obtain another Kaiju brain to drift with it. Newton realises the Kaiju hive mind gained access to his brain, since drifting is a two-way link, and two new Kaiju, Leatherback and Otachi, are sent simultaneously to find him.\n\nAll Jaegers save Gipsy Danger are dispatched to intervene. The Kaiju destroy Crimson Typhoon and Cherno Alpha and kill their pilots, while Leatherback paralyzes Striker Eureka with an EMP blast. Pentecost sends Gipsy Danger to help, the only Jaeger powered by a nuclear reactor while the others are digital. Gipsy kills Leatherback and Otachi shortly after during her search for Newton. Newton and Hannibal go to harvest Otachi\u2019s secondary brain, discovering she is pregnant. The infant Kaiju bursts out, devours Hannibal, before choking on its own umbilical cord. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant\u2019s brain, discovering the Breach only opens in the presence of a Kaiju\u2019s DNA.\n\nPentecost reveals to Raleigh he has terminal cancer due to piloting a first-generation Jaeger which lacked radiation shielding. The last time he piloted a Jaeger was in the Tokyo attack, during which he was forced to kill the Kaiju alone, making him and Raleigh the only pilots who have piloted a Jaeger without a copilot (known as solo combat). Two new Kaiju are detected guarding the Breach, prompting Gipsy and Striker, piloted by Pentecost and Chuck, to go ahead with the assault. Approaching the Breach, the Jaegers are attacked by the Kaiju, and a new \u201cCategory Five\u201d Kaiju, Slattern, leading to Striker being crippled. Learning the truth from Newton and Hermann, Pentecost and Chuck decide to sacrifice Striker while Gipsy acts as the nuclear bomb to seal the Breach. After Striker self-destructs, Gipsy slaughters the Kaiju, riding Slattern\u2019s corpse into the Breach. Raleigh removes Mako from Gipsy, manually causing Gipsy to self-destruct, escaping before it explodes and seals the Breach.",
