She is convinced that her father, Jack Winston (John Savage), murdered her mother (Kiva Dawson). In a quest for vengeance, Samantha uncovers an evil and devastating truth.\n\nSamantha tried to escape tragedy much of her life.

However, harsh reminders of her father's drunken rampages and the sudden death of her 32-year-old mother dominate her thoughts. She is convinced that her father, 20 years her mother's senior, a jealous and verbally abusive alcoholic, committed this unthinkable crime.\n\nIn the exhaustive search for evidence Samantha seeks answers from Lucas Drake (Steven Bauer), her mother's best friend and a successful funeral director and mortuary owner, and her Uncle Thomas (Edward Furlong), among others.
