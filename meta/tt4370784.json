  "plot": "Jeanne, a young woman born and raised in Northern France, is visiting the Mediterranean for the first time. She arrives at the southern French seaport of Toulon to attend the wedding of her older sister Ma\u00eft\u00e9 to Nourredine, a North African. However, her main goal is to repatriate her deaf-mute younger brother, Alain, with whom she had been living following the death of their parents. At the wedding celebration, Jeanne meets Klotz, a middle age orchestra conductor prone to drinking. Jeanne re-encounter with Alain is not a happy one. She learns that her teenager brother has been supporting himself pickpocketing under the tutelage of Sa\u00efd, a Frenchman of Algerian descent who approached Jeanne on her arrival in the city. Jeanne sleeps next to her brother; but the next morning, Alain runs away stealing all of Jeanne\u2019s money, even a family heirloom that she has brought as a wedding gift for Ma\u00eft\u00e9.\n\nDesperate to find Alain, Jeanne goes to the elementary school where Ma\u00eft\u00e9 works, to see if she knows where Alain might be. Ma\u00eft\u00e9 is disappointed with her two siblings and she is in no mood to help. In her lunch hour from work, a lover is waiting for Ma\u00eft\u00e9, who confesses to Jeanne that she got married with Nourredine only to have a child.\n\nJeanne's first lead in finding her brother is the struggling orchestra conductor Klotz, a bisexual older man who is infatuated with Sa\u00efd. Sa\u00efd treats Klotz very badly, but Klotz lust after the handsome and cocky Sa\u00efd. When Jeanne visits Klotz's luxurious beach-side villa, she meets Klot'z son St\u00e9phane, who is recovering from a coma, and St\u00e9phane's overbearing mother, Myrian. St\u00e9phane is immediately attracted to Jeanne and takes her in his motorcycle to the auditorium where his father is rehearsing with his orchestra.\n\nWhen Jeanne finds Alain, she moves into the modest hotel he shares with Sa\u00efd, which is run by a repatriated Pied-Noir from Algeria. At the same time Jeanne starts a relationship with St\u00e9phane, but there is a secret link between St\u00e9phane and Sa\u00efd. Sa\u00efd takes Jeanne to see a burns victim and reveals to her that St\u00e9phane had once been part of a far right racist gang which had set fire to an immigrant hostel, and was later stabbed by Sa\u00efd in revenge.\n\nDuring a brief stay in Algeria, Sa\u00efd telephones St\u00e9phane to tell him of the night he has spent with Jeanne, which motivates St\u00e9phane to denounce Sa\u00efd to the racist gang. However, St\u00e9phane catches up with Sa\u00efd and warns him not to go back to the hotel. Sa\u00efd, however, drags St\u00e9phane with him and they are both shot dead. The film ends with Jeanne staring at the two bodies.",
