  "storyline": "WHAT TOMORROW BRINGS is a v\u00e9rit\u00e9 feature documentary that tells the story of the first all-girls' school in a small Afghan village. It traces the interconnected stories of students, teachers, village elders, parents, and school founder Razia Jan. The story plays out at a critical moment in Afghanistan's history, when international security forces are pulling out and the Taliban is increasingly exerting its power. The narrative structure is built on the voices of four intergenerational women, while the school itself and surrounding community, especially the village Mayor and elders, play strong supporting roles.",
