  "overview": "A young man runs away from home only to find that the world he is running to isn't quite what he anticipated.",
  "storyline": "It has been one year since Luke graduated from high school, yet he chose not to go to college and quit his job last week. When his parents confront him about going to community college (or at least doing something with himself), Luke decides to run away from home to avoid responsibility. However, on his first night out on his own he is robbed and beaten to a bloody pulp by a local gang. With nothing left in his immediate possession, he wanders the streets for a few days only to stumble upon the gang that beat him up. His actions that day will change his life forever, but could change the lives of others for the better as well.",
