  "overview": "The story of Abdellah\u2019s coming of age in two parts \u2014 first as a teenager in Morocco, the second as a university student in Geneva. Inspired by the filmmaker\u2019s own autobiographical novel that carries the same title, Salvation Army is as much a film about inhibition, hypocrisy, brutality, and shame as it is about desire, love, dignity and survival.",
  "storyline": "Abdellah is a young gay man navigating the sexual, racial and political climate of Morocco. Growing up in a large family in a working-class neighborhood, Abdellah is caught between a distant father, an authoritarian mother, an older brother whom he adores and a handful of predatory older men, in a society that denies his homosexuality. As a college student, Abdellah moves to Geneva and while faced with the new possibilities of freedom, he grapples with the loss of his homeland. SALVATION ARMY, the directorial debut for Abdellah Ta\u00efa - an acclaimed Moroccan and Arab writer - is adapted from his novel of the same name. Ta\u00efa is the first writer of his descent to speak out openly about his homosexuality.",
