  "plot": "Buddy Hutchins is just a regular guy doing his best to support a wife and two kids. A recovering alcoholic, Buddy hasn't had a drink for the better part of a year, but it turns out the only reward for his good behavior is a failing business and his wife Joanne cheating on him with a man named Shane. Pushed over the edge and armed with a chainsaw, Buddy Hutchins is out for blood.\n\nBuddy finally snaps when a group of teenagers (Betty, Collin, Ellie, Gary, Fred, Patricia and Tommy) drive through his fence. When they go to camp in the woods, he drops his kids off at daycare before beheading Shane and hanging Joanne. Buddy then follows the teens to their campsite. When Gary goes fishing, Buddy dismembers him and uses his entrails as bait. He then finds Fred and Betty having sex and bashes Fred's head in before disemboweling Betty.\n\nPatricia feels guilty and goes back to the farm to apologize, but discovers the dead bodies of Shane and Joanne. Meanwhile, back at camp, Tommy and Ellie see Buddy dismembering Collin while they are making out on a cliff. The two run back towards camp and meet up with Patricia. The three then flee the camp and head towards town. Buddy prepares to commit suicide, but finds a love letter Patricia had written to give to Tommy and falls in love with her. He then chases the car Patricia, Tommy and Ellie are driving in. He takes the unconscious Patricia back to his house and leaves the other two behind.\n\nTommy and Ellie wake up and chase Buddy to his house. They break into Buddy's house and free Patricia, but Buddy impales Ellie. Patricia and Tommy then flee and hide in Buddy's truck. He discovers them and they battle him for survival. Buddy beheads Tommy, but Patricia manages to hit Buddy on the head with a shovel, seemingly killing him. Patricia kisses Buddy's forehead, and he suddenly leaps up and grabs her. However, Patricia still manages to kill Buddy with his own chainsaw. Patricia then leaves as the only survivor.",
