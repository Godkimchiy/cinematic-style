  "overview": "A catholic French couple sees their life upside down when their four daughters get married to men of different religion and origins.",
  "storyline": "The Verneuils are Catholic. They are also a well-off, well-educated , well-intentioned, well-thought of couple. Everything would be for the best in the best of worlds if three of their daughters had not married three young men... of different religions and origins. So, the day their fourth girl tells them that she is going to marry a Catholic they are on cloud nine...",
  "plot": "Claude Verneuil, a Gaullist notary, and his wife Marie, a Catholic bourgeois from Chinon, are parents of four daughters: Isabelle, Odile, S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne, and Laure. The three eldest are already married to men, each one of a different religion and a different ethnic origin: Isabelle married Rashid Ben Assem, an Algerian Muslim lawyer, Odile married David Benichou, a Sephardi Jew entrepreneur, and S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne married Chao Ling, a Han Chinese banker who is open to all religious beliefs. The Verneuils pretend to accept their sons-in-law but have had a hard time hiding their discomfort at accepting people into the family from outside the community. A family meeting is spoiled because of the awkwardness and clich\u00e9s about race and religion, expressed as much by the father as by the sons-in-law who even exchange insulting communitarian views to and about each other.\n\nThe Verneuils, in despair, put all their hope in their youngest daughter Laure, that she will bring home a Catholic partner, going so far as to arrange an \"accidental\" meeting with Xavier, a young Catholic man who works in finance. However, Laure reveals that she had chosen a Catholic partner named Charles Kofi, and wishes to marry him. Laure's parents are overjoyed and readily forgive his occupation as a comedian and actor. On the first meeting, however, they are shocked when they discover that the man to whom their daughter is engaged is a West African from the Ivory Coast. Claude begins to sink into depression and spends his time cutting down trees and fishing. Meanwhile, the three sons-in-law get together and plan to stop Laure's marriage out of fear that their friendship will be threatened by a fourth member.\n\nWhen the Verneuils meet with the Kofis, Marie and Charles' mother Madeline get along well, but Claude finds that Charles' father Andr\u00e9 is an intolerant, tough, stingy military man and extremely resentful of white colonisation and white supremacy in Africa. Both the groom's and bride's party come head to head and the fathers' disapproval and racist views heat up the situation. On the day before the wedding, Andr\u00e9 goes out with Claude fishing and unexpectedly find common ground in their dislikes, as both are Gaullists (Charles de Gaulle), and develop a friendship. After catching a large pike, the two go to a restaurant, become drunk with wine and are arrested at the p\u00e2tisserie after saying racist comments. Laure is notably upset at this and boards a train, deciding to end the marriage; Andr\u00e9 and Claude catch the train and persuade Laure to marry Charles. Laure agrees and the film ends with a happy marriage and a night of the family dancing coup\u00e9-d\u00e9cal\u00e9.",
