  "storyline": "JOSE STERN -- formerly Joseph Stern, until he discovered he was 1/8th Mexican -- is on the precipice of turning 40. Going on 75. He and his band, The Borges, have been relegated to playing childrens' birthday parties. He was always a little miserable. Now he's very miserable. Thankfully, he has in essence the perfect woman to balance him. DUSTY, his fiance, is a warm, beautiful, laid back, supportive, veterinarian. She is the Yin to his Yang. That is, until she discovers a old secret of Jose and kicks him out and into the warm bosom of his falling-apart-at-the-seams-married-with-children friends' home , where he spends the rest of film seeking counsel from his burnt out friends, dates an insane ex-girlfriend, and sorts through his past, all in an effort to find himself... and perhaps Dusty.",
