  "overview": "Cerise is fourteen years old but she looks twenty. Cerise grew up on the outskirts, but now she's exiled to Ukraine. Cerise wears excessive amounts of makeup, but she still has a little girl's dreams. Cerise doesn't know her father, even though she's going to have to live with him. Cerise has only ever thought about herself and now she finds herself in the middle of a revolution.",
  "storyline": "Cerise is a 14 year old girl acting out so much that her mom sends her to her father in Ukraine, and there she grows up quite a bit. It is not a political movie, more a film about growing, and the changes we see are believable. Her dreams are great: music videos in her head like a singer she loves and her life as a soldier.",
