  "overview": "A search and rescue team are transported through deep space to a distant mining colony to save the sole survivor of a biological outbreak.  During their mission, they find a lethal weapon which is set to arrive on Earth within the hour.",
  "storyline": "An elite 'search and rescue' team transport onto an off-world mining-facility to rescue Whit Carmichael, the lone survivor of a biological outbreak.",
  "plot": "In the early 23rd century, an emergency is declared on a mining station O.I. Infini, and a search and rescue (SAR) team is sent in using Slipstream, a form of teleportation that allows near instantaneous travel. The location of O.I. Infini is proximal to a number of black holes meaning the mission operatives will experience severe time dilation. A team sent returns 30 seconds later in a berserk rage. Whit Carmichael, a new member of West Coast SAR, on his first day, teleports to Infini using an illegal teleporter after West Coast HQ activates a lethal lock down to contain the crisis. Before leaving for work that day, his wife tells him to do whatever it takes to return safely.\n\nLess than a relative hour later, East Coast SAR is informed about the outbreak and the destruction of the West Coast SAR. They are informed a payload of something from the station has been programed by a deranged survivor, to teleport soon to Earth, which will destroy the planet. The SAR is ordered to halt the payload, and recover the one surviving member of the West Coast SAR, Whit. Arriving, they find a frozen slaughterhouse, eventually reuniting with Whit, who has had a week to figure out how the station operates. Whit explains that the mining staff slaughtered each other, tearing off their skin and killing one another. Whit is able to shut down the payload, but then the deranged survivor suddenly attacks, and when he is shot, everyone is sprayed with the survivor's blood. They begin to become enraged and violent. Whit hides from the others, then searches the station for remaining SAR personnel and anything he can learn about the infection. Finding a lab, he discovers a medical log. Discovering the planet is entirely composed of alien organic material, and when thawed forms a so-called \"primordial ooze\". It is capable of infecting, eventually mimicking and finally dominating, any biological tissue. He further discovers the ooze is aggressive, predatory in nature, and driven by self-preservation.\n\nSuffering mentally from infection, Whit attempts to solicit help from the remaining members of the team, but they are suffering through advanced stages of the infection, which he is resisting better. They either attack each other, kill themselves, or attack Whit. This leaves Whit the last surviving human on the station. He records a message to the ooze which plays on a loop over the loudspeakers, criticizing it for harnessing only the violent instincts of humanity, instead of working with humans. He tells it that it failed. He then commits suicide. The ooze moves onto the bodies, and they awaken unharmed and no longer crazed, but clearly disturbed by what has happened. They agree to teleport back, and keep their story simple. As they begin to teleportation, Whit sees several humanoid forms made of ooze, silently watching them go, one of them holding the picture of Whit's wife he carried with him.\n\nReturning to Earth, the team is scanned, and asked if they are free from biological contaminants. They answer in the affirmative, and the scan successfully identifies them all. Whit returns home to his wife, who had been told he was not coming back.",
