  "overview": "A series of snapshots from the life of a fictional actress named Shirley serves to weave together thirteen paintings by Edward Hopper (e.g. \"Office at Night\", \"Western Motel\", \"Usherette\", \"A Woman in the Sun\") into a fascinating synthesis of painting and film, personal and political history. Each station in Shirley\u2019s professional and private life from the 1930s to 1960s is precisely dated: It is always August 28/29 of the year in question, as the locations vary from Paris to New York to Cape Cod.",
  "storyline": "13 of Edward Hopper's paintings are brought alive by the film, telling the story of a woman, whose thoughts, emotions and contemplations let us observe an era in American history. Shirley is a woman in America in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and early '60s. A woman who would like to influence the course of history with her professional and socio political involvement.",
