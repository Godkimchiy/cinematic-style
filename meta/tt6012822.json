  "storyline": "\"Certain things must be done now. This way, if you are sentenced to 20 years, when you go out of jail, you still have a whole life ahead\" This is the understanding of the world of an army of \"child soldiers\" - boys who learn to shoot at 10, who become experienced killers by 20, and often don't get to turn 30. In Naples, in the past couple of years, trigger-happy teenagers has fought a forgotten war that currently counts at least 60 dead. Locals call them \"the paranza of children\" (in the criminal jargon, paranza stands for a group of Camorrists), i.e. young rebels who are imposing new rules in the control of the drug trade. For the very first time on screen, the real baby bosses talk about themselves in a frank, unmediated manner. They are young people who skipped compulsory schooling and are often barely able to speak Italian - still, they voice such fierce sentiments and dangerous passions whose disruptive power is totally unknown to the \"normal\" Country.",
