Dusty's Trail celebrates life through ties that bind all humanity. It's about the power of creating a positive, happy, fulfilling and inspiring life when the odds seem against it. Filmed in Borneo and California, the documentary is based on interviews with doctors, researchers, parents, friends and people who have been inspired by Dusty's life, some with whom he has never met, and others who share the same path.",
