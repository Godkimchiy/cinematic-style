  "storyline": "Fleeing away from a violent husband, Anna and her son Valerio struggle with the life in a new city.",
  "plot": "In 1939 in the Kingdom of Italy, Guido Orefice is a young Jewish man who arrives to work in the city where his uncle Eliseo operates a restaurant. Guido is comical and sharp, and falls in love with a girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to a rich but arrogant man, a local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \"coincidental\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally Dora sees Guido's affection and promise and gives in against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party on a horse, humiliating her fianc\u00e9 and mother. They are later married and have a son, Giosu\u00e8, and own a book store.\n\nWhen World War II breaks out, Guido, his uncle, and Giosu\u00e8 are seized on Giosu\u00e8's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a concentration camp. After confronting a guard about her husband and son and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to send messages\u2014symbolic or literal\u2014to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is executed in a gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosu\u00e8 barely avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers.\n\nIn the camp, Guido hides their true situation from his son. Guido explains to Giosu\u00e8 that the camp is a complicated game in which he must perform the tasks Guido gives him. Each of the tasks will earn them points and whoever gets to one thousand points first will win a tank. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn extra points. Giosu\u00e8 is at times reluctant to go along with the game, but Guido convinces him each time to continue.\n\nGuido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the Allied forces approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final competition before the tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but while he is out he is caught by a German soldier. An officer makes the decision to execute Guido, who is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosu\u00e8 one last time, still in character and playing the game. He winks at Giosu\u00e8 and Giosu\u00e8 winks back as Guido is led away to be shot. The next morning, Giosu\u00e8 emerges from the sweat-box, just as a U.S. Army unit led by a Sherman tank arrives and the camp is liberated. The prisoners travel to safety, accompanied by the Americans. Giosu\u00e8 soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and are reunited. Later, as a man, Giosu\u00e8 realizes his father's story of sacrifice for his family.",
