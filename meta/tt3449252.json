  "overview": "According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, one veteran dies by suicide in America every 80 minutes. While only 1% of Americans has served in the military, former service members account for 20% of all suicides in the U.S. Based in Canandaigua, NY and open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, the Veterans Crisis Line receives more than 22,000 calls each month from veterans of all conflicts who are struggling or contemplating suicide. This timely documentary spotlights the traumas endured by America\u2019s veterans, as seen through the work of the hotline\u2019s trained responders. CRISIS HOTLINE captures extremely private moments, where the professionals, many of whom are themselves veterans or veterans\u2019 spouses, can often interrupt the thoughts and plans of suicidal callers to steer them out of crisis.",

Now, many military veterans must turn to the unique services of the Veterans' Crisis Line to help with their own personal and professional traumas at home.
