  "overview": "How to become a man when your mother and your closed circle have decided otherwise? This is the challenge Guillaume took up. The film recounts Guillaume's tragicomic battle from the young age of eight, as he adopts the role of a girl then of a homosexual... until, aged 30, he meets the woman who, after his mother, will become the other woman in his life. Beyond this story of a heterosexual coming-out, the film tells the tale of an actor who never stopped loving women, maybe even a little too much.",
  "storyline": "Mrs. Gallienne, a rather temperamental upper middle-class lady, has three children, two of whom she considers as her sons and another she calls Guillaume. Logically indeed, the latter teenage creature does not picture himself as a boy, rather as a girl or at best as a homosexual. But how can a mother act in such an objectionable way? And why? Through a series of painful chain of experiences, Guillaume will discover little by little who he is actually and will manage to break free from her pernicious influence.",
  "plot": "In a theatre, Guillaume recounts how his life developed as a youth. As a young effeminate boy, his mother casually dismisses his antics. When he asks to go learn Spanish, his mother sends him to La L\u00ednea de la Concepci\u00f3n. There he stays with Paqui, a Spanish woman unable to speak French. As they awkwardly try to communicate, she suggests teaching him how to dance the sevillanas. Becoming proficient, Guillaume dances at a local festival but is subjected to laughter. Oblivious to why, he asks a woman named Pilar to dance with him. She politely refuses, explaining to him how he dances like a girl. He asks her if she thinks he looks like a girl. She agrees and he happily remarks that his mother would be delighted.\n\nFascinated by his mother, Guillaume imitates her voice to the family cook and his grandmother, Babou. His father, however, is dissatisfied with his son's behaviour. After catching him pretending to be Sissi, his father sends him away to an all-boys boarding school. Unable to withstand the constant taunting, Guillaume writes a plea to his father. Following a psychiatric assessment, his parents decide to transfer him to an English boarding school.\n\nGuillaume revels in his new school, a place where he is no longer judged by his personality. He develops an attraction to a schoolboy named Jeremy, but is heartbroken when he discovers Jeremy having sex with a girl. While his mother tries to console him, she inadvertently blurts out that he is homosexual; a thought that did not initially occur to him. He gains exemption from his national service because of his fragile state.\n\nAfter a series of psychotherapy sessions, Guillaume decides to visit a Bavarian spa to relax. There he is given a painful sports massage by Raymund and an unexpected colonic by Ingeborg. Still conflicted about his sexuality, he is advised by his aunt to experiment. During his first attempt, he introduces himself to a man named Karim at a nightclub and follows him home. At Karim's flat, he finds two other men waiting to gang bang him. He escapes after Karim realises that he is not an Arab. In his second attempt, he meets a well-endowed man and panics.\n\nEventually, Guillaume meets a woman named Amandine at a friend's dinner party. He falls in love and they get engaged. When broaching the subject to his mother, she begins to question his sexuality. Guillaume realises that she finds this difficult to accept because she fears losing him to another woman.",
