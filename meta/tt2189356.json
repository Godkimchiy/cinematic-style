When faced with moving back home, he ambivalently teams up with his old best friend (Andy Gillies) for an impractical t-shirt business.Amid their differing priorities and illusions of success, the friends' future begins to take shape when they unexpectedly meet a lively girl (Cindy Pinzon) who mockingly diagnoses Lonnie's life predicament as\nmere self-importance.The hopeless business struggles to develop until a twelve year old (Kruz Karstedt) steals the boy's fateful ideas turning them to gold. The newly found talent is just enough to send the fledgling men reeling for\nanswers to a business deal gone bad.The boys plot a pointless revenge landing them in more trouble than bargained for, leaving them to realize that sometimes life's short-comings are just life worth living."
