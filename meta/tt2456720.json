  "plot": "He became mayor of Marina di Sopra (a small village in Calabria): now the corrupt and ignorant fugitive entrepreneur Cetto La Qualunque really wants to govern by doing nothing and relying on the support of his friends. But soon the police Cavallaro manages to trick him and send him to prison along with his entire gang, including the funny Pino \"The Stranger\" (as for the inhabitants of Calabria citizens of Apulia appear as non-EU citizens). In Veneto in Northern Italy, the manufacturer Rodolfo \"Olfo\" Favaretto (Antonio Albanese) dreamboat years, the project of unifying the Italian regions of Piedmont of Lombardia, the Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Veneto by a long highway to the Austria. In fact, he, as a great secessionist what, he wants to bring Italy in the time of eighteenth century when Austro-Hungarian Empire dominated the entire North. One day he escort Venice in his bunker in a group of men blacks illegal dealing in the most inhuman in a speedboat guide for sea channels of the city, making them look like tourists not to be stopped by the police. When Rudolph arrives at his shipyard orders to illegal immigrants to get to work to build his \"strap\" (highway), but a black man falls from the roof of the yard and does not give any sign of life. Rodolfo to have no trouble really wants to put the body in a plastic bag and throw it in the channel, but the man is not dead and report it to the police. Frengo Stoppato (also Albanese) is a drug addict who lives happily in the Brazil until a call from the mother brings him back in Italy. It is a deception because the woman is arrested for forcing son to Catholic dune profound conversion, which should end with a beatification premature, i.e. before Frengo die, to be revered by all as a holy man.\n\nMeanwhile, in Rome at Montecitorio politicians, corrupt and petty people axis, decide with the consent of the Secretary of the Prime Minister (Fabrizio Bentivoglio) and the President's of the Italian Republic to include in their power play three new Members, as most recently were arrested. Among them is also the Chairman of the Board (Paolo Villaggio) who thinks only to gain weight and to gorge themselves money and food like a turkey I are lucky Cetto, Rodolfo and Frengo that are treated like royalty, with the mansions and luxury apartments, that can begin to govern along with the other Italy, or have fun in the most wild and do nothing all day. Only one thing the Secretary recommended to the three swear allegiance and never betray him. The matter, Favaretto Stoppato and will do anything to maintain the integrity and solidify their position and Montecitorio m wing their ineptitude, their meanness of character and habits, and particularly their ideals will only create trouble for the government buildings. In fact, the Secretary has made a mistake because he chose not professional \"Art of Swindle\" and fend for themselves, but of the provincial administrators who think only of their directives. The Cetto La Qualunque the time in which is a Member of the House does not appear even once to the House to vote, also has a big problem of sexual tastes. In fact, he has not abandoned the sake of having sex with beautiful girls, but a haunting happens to him a transsexual for a short time will change the taste on their partners. This is to Cetto is like a saber, it is as if he had been deprived of his dignity because he believes homosexuals of being ugly and unclean and become one of them would be the end. Frengo continues its path to beatification asking for an audience even to the pope Benedict XVI after that caught his attention with a change in the fee for the poor, where most of the gains ended the Cardinals of St. Peter. As if that were not enough, he believes that the family of Jesus, Mary and Joseph is not that perfect precisely because God has fertilized the Madonna and then the carpenter has recognized Christ as his son. Finally Riodolfo begins to hate people of color in a frightening way, not trusting even the gentle and cultured goalkeeper tree houses where, as he comes from Africa and bearing his motorway project in House. He plans to destroy only a few natural reserve, shack where the immigrants live and finally dry up the rivers, but in fact the disaster that is going to cause huge and will be booed by everyone.",
