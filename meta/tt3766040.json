  "overview": "Former high school classmates reunite and rehash old rivalries.",
  "storyline": "A Legacy of Whining not only throws gasoline on the familiar cinematic trope of male mid-life crisis but watches gleefully as it sits back and throws a lighted match onto the proceedings. Inspired by its love of early 1970's American buddy films, this shaggy dog comedy (played out in one desperation-soaked dreamlike evening) tells the tale of two former high school friends, Mitch and Dunc, who reunite thirty years later in an attempt to resurrect the faded corpse of their \"glory years\" only to find, perhaps, that the past ain't all it's cracked up to be... \"A Legacy of Whining\" is really funny!\"- The Movie Waffler.com",
  "plot": null,
  "synopsis": "The past aint all its cracked up to be especially when one tries in vain to recapture the former glory and innocence of their cherished youth as two former high school friends reunite thirty years later in a painfully comedic and bittersweet rollercoaster of an evening.\nMitch, a struggling actor and inveterate whiner bent on recapturing the old magic at all costs, waits in heightened anticipation in the Arrivals section of the airport until finally spotting his ex-school chum, Dunc, now an overweight boozer and womanizer, leading to an awkward embrace that starts the clock ticking on these long lost friends nocturnal fever dream into the heart of darkness of old wounds, unrealized dreams, and dashed hopes.\nThe following mornings sun announces a new dawn as an exhausted and disillusioned Mitch, having already abandoned his old friend to the nights misadventures, manages to show up in the nick of time to his acting audition where, standing all alone and emotionally naked up onstage, suddenly comes face to face with the totality of his life's choices."
