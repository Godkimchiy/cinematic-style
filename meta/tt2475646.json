She leaves the Hohenstein Castle and heads to the lands of the independent Solkony that are preparing to a war against the Hussitas that want the right of free will to follow the religion they want. Along her journey, Maria will meet leaders and will help to bring peace to Solkony. But her beloved Michel is amnesic and does not recall his previous life with her.",
