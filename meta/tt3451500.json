  "plot": "The main cast of Predator. Left to right: Ventura, Black, Schwarzenegger, Duke, Weathers, Landham, and Chaves\nA spacecraft flies near Earth and deposits a bright object which enters the atmosphere. In the Val Verde jungle, Major Alan \"Dutch\" Schaefer and his six-man team, consisting of mercenary Mac Elliot, tracker and recon specialist Billy Sole, support gunner Blaine Cooper, demolitions and explosives expert Jorge \"Poncho\" Ram\u00edrez, and radio operator Rick Hawkins, are tasked by the CIA with rescuing an official held hostage by insurgents. CIA agent and liaison Colonel George Dillon, a former commando and an old friend of Dutch's, is assigned to supervise the team despite Dutch's reservations.\n\nThe team discovers the wreckage of a chopper and three skinned corpses, whom Dutch identifies as members of a U.S. Army Special Forces unit he knew personally. They reach the insurgent camp and kill the soldiers, including a Soviet intelligence officer searching through secret CIA documents. Confronted by Dutch, Dillon admits the mission was a setup to retrieve intelligence from captured operatives and that the dead unit disappeared weeks earlier in a failed rescue. After capturing a guerilla named Anna, the group proceeds to extraction, unaware that they are being tracked with thermal imaging by an unseen observer.\n\nAnna escapes and is chased by Hawkins, but they are ambushed by the creature. It spares Anna but kills Hawkins and drags his body away. Dutch organizes a manhunt, during which Blaine is killed by the creature's plasma weapon. An enraged Mac initiates a firefight which wounds the creature, revealing luminescent green blood, but fails to draw it out. The unit regroups and questions Anna, learning that their stalker is a creature locals call \"el demonio que hace trofeos de los hombres\", the demon who makes trophies of men.\n\nThat night, Mac mistakes a wild pig for the creature and kills it. In the confusion, the creature steals Blaine's body, leading Dutch to realize their enemy uses the trees to travel. The next day, an attempt to trap the creature fails, leaving Poncho injured. Mac and Dillon pursue the alien but it outwits and kills them both. It catches up with the others, killing Billy and Poncho and wounding Dutch.\n\nRealizing the creature does not target unarmed prey because there is \"no sport\", Dutch sends Anna to the helicopter unarmed. The creature pursues him through a river, causing its cloaking device to malfunction. Though the creature is only a few feet from Dutch, he does not see him and moves on. Dutch realizes that mud covering his body is masking his heat signature from the creature's thermal sensor.\n\nWhile the creature removes the spinal columns from the bodies, Dutch crafts traps and weapons and lures the creature with a war cry. He disables its cloaking device and inflicts minor injuries, but is cornered. Acknowledging Dutch as a worthy foe, the creature discards its mask and weapon and engages him in hand-to-hand combat. Dutch is almost beaten but crushes the creature under a counterweight. As the creature lies dying, Dutch asks \"What the hell are you?\", but it simply repeats the question in garbled English before activating a self-destruct device, echoing Billy's laughter as the countdown begins. Dutch takes cover just before the self-destruct device explodes in a mushroom cloud. He is picked up by his commander, General Phillips, and finds Anna in the helicopter.",
