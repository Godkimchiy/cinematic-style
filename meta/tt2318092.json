  "overview": "When beautiful Jade (Gabriella Wilde) meets charismatic David (Alex Pettyfer), her sheltered world of privilege is turned upside down as the pair's instant desire sparks a reckless summer love affair. While Jade leaves behind her inhibitions and innocence as she falls for David, he works to prove himself worthy of her love. But when David's mysterious past and Jade's overprotective father threaten to tear them apart, their romance will be put to the ultimate test.",
  "storyline": "David has had a crush on Jade since the first time he saw her in the tenth grade. With high school coming to an end, David has never spoken to her until her family pulls up to The Inn, where David works as a valet. She and David fall madly in love, a love that only grows stronger as parents try to tear them apart. David knows Jade's past, but as his secrets are slowly revealed, Jade's trust is tested and leaves them wondering if they are truly meant to be together.",
  "plot": "Beautiful-but-shy Atlanta native Jade Butterfield, age 17, has not made any friends throughout her four years of high school. She has missed a social life in favor of studies, wanting to do well in memory of her eldest brother Chris - who died from cancer. David Elliot, another graduating senior, has had a crush on her since they were both freshmen, yet he never had the courage to act on said crush.\n\nJade - along with her elder brother Keith, and their parents Hugh and Anne - stop at an upscale restaurant where David works as a parking valet. When Jade drops her (empty) yearbook, David retrieves it, mentions that they were classmates and agrees to sign it. Inside the restaurant, Jade asks her parents for a graduation party. When Anne and Hugh approve, Jade excitedly invites David. David thrills Jade by taking her on a brief joyride in the car of a snobby guest - partly in retaliation for the guest's demeaning behavior toward David's best friend Mace, another valet. David punches the client when he insults Jade; this gets David and Mace fired, but wins Jade's appreciation.\n\nJade's party disappoints her at first. Then David arrives and informs Jade their classmates are attending another graduation party, one being held that same evening by his former girlfriend Jenny. David gets a large crowd of their peers to attend Jade's party by calling in a false noise complaint to the police. Bonding that night, Jade and David sneak into a closet where they share a kiss. Hugh gathers everybody together for a speech about how proud he is of Jade. When called for, Jade sheepishly comes out of the closet followed by David. Her father completes the toast and then politely asks them all to leave.\n\nDavid introduces himself and apologizes to Hugh for making such a bad first impression. David makes it clear how much he cares for Jade - who secretly listens to this conversation from inside the house, and who is delighted by his words. As David leaves, Jade runs after him for a passionate kiss.\n\nDavid, who works at his widowed father Harry's garage, tries to please Hugh by fixing Chris's broken car. Ironically, Hugh is the only one not pleased by David's gesture. Anne invites David to dinner, over which Hugh reveals that Jade is soon leaving for an internship. When asked of his future plans, David states that - despite scoring high on his SATs - his main goal is to keep working as an auto mechanic and to find true love with \"the\" girl. While Anne is impressed, Hugh finds it unrealistic. As David is leaving, Jade throws him a paper plane from her balcony - asking him to come back when the lights are off. He does so and finds Jade waiting for him in a sheer negligee by the fireplace. Jade was ready for sex. David assures her they can wait, but Jade insists that \"I want to feel this with you,\" and the two have sex.\n\nJade explains to David that she cannot pass up the internship, for which she's leaving in ten days. They agree to make the most of their remaining time together. A montage shows them enjoying each other\u2019s company with reckless abandon. After what was intended to be their final evening together, Jade decides to spend the summer with him. When she explains this change of heart to her father, Hugh knows it\u2019s because of David and is furious.\n\nThe next morning, Jade's father announces that the family is going to their lake house - obviously to keep her and David away from each other. She invites David, who indeed shows up; he is welcomed with open arms by everybody except Hugh, who demands that David leave. Jade makes it very clear that she wants David to stay. When Hugh talks with Anne about Jade's uncharacteristically bold self-assertiveness, Anne is pleased to see their daughter truly happy for the first time since they buried Chris. When David is convinced to apply for college, Anne writes a letter of recommendation in order to bolster his admission. That night, David is shocked to find Hugh cheating on his wife in the garage. The next morning, Hugh intimidates David into remaining quiet about the affair.\n\nMace, the Butterfield siblings, David, and Keith's girlfriend Sabine sneak into a local zoo after hours for a night of fun. To get even with David for sabotaging her graduation party, Jenny informs the police about said break-in. David also has a suitcase full of heroin with him. David lets the police catch him so that the others can escape. Hugh agrees to bail David out, on the condition that Jade leaves as planned for her internship. When Hugh tells David that his relationship with Jade is over, David speculates on what Hugh's family would think of him for his cheating. Hugh counters this by revealing that David's late mother cheated on Harry shortly before her death. In the process, Hugh manipulates David into punching him. Returning home, Hugh proclaims that David is out of control. Jade seeks out David to learn his side of things. Mace, figuring that David could use a sympathetic ear, invites Jenny over for lunch; as luck would have it, Jade shows up just as David and Jenny are in the middle of a chat. Jumping to the wrong conclusion, Jade accuses David of not having it in him to do what is necessary for maintaining a relationship like theirs. She drives off in a fit and is slammed from the side by another car.\n\nAt the hospital, Hugh gives Harry a copy of the restraining order which is to keep David away from Jade. Harry protests, but to no effect. Jade wakes up, having suffered only minor injuries. She wants to see David, realizing now that he was never unfaithful to her and never would be. Jade goes to the Elliot residence, but Harry won't let her inside since doing so would land David in prison.\n\nOver the next few months, David and Jade each try to move on with their lives - including seeing other people - but neither is happy. Then David runs into Anne at a bookstore. She tells him that she's always admired his and Jade's love for each other. Anne arranges for David to meet her daughter at the airport, when Jade comes home for the holidays. The teenagers reaffirm their love, and Jade plans to move in with David that night...while Anne confronts Hugh about his obsession with destroying David's life. Anne learns that Hugh prevented her recommendation letter for David from being sent out to college. Anne makes clear her disapproval of what Hugh has let himself become in the years since Chris's untimely demise.\n\nIn the shrine that was his brother's bedroom, Keith and Sabine enjoy records from Chris's collection - despite Hugh's orders never to do so. Discovering this, Hugh reams Sabine and his son for their defiance. Keith, who angrily seconds his mom's feelings about what losing Chris has done to Hugh, announces that he's moving out of the Butterfield residence and in with Sabine; Anne goes with them. Hugh finds Jade preparing to go off with David, who is waiting outside. Hugh furiously attacks David with a baseball bat...accusing the younger man of generating a rift between him, his wife, and their children. Jade rushes to David's defense, proclaiming that it was not him but Hugh himself who tore their family apart.\n\nAs the defeated Hugh returns inside, a smoke alarm goes off. A candle, which was knocked over during Hugh's confrontation with Jade in Chris's room, has started a fire. Just as David and Jade are leaving, they see the Butterfield house in flames. David rushes inside as Hugh struggles to rescue his late son's belongings from the bedroom, which is now an inferno. When David is knocked unconscious by a backdraft, Hugh leaves Chris\u2019s possessions behind and instead helps David out of the burning house. Both men put aside their differences, Hugh having finally recovered from his son's death.\n\nAnne and Hugh amicably get a separation. Jade visits Chris's grave, en route to meeting David at the airport. They fly to meet Sabine and Keith in California. To David and Jade's surprise, they are welcomed as Maid of Honor and Best Man for Keith and Sabine's private wedding. Both couples celebrate on the beach, where they camp for the night. Jade and David share a bedroll, gazing contentedly at the stars overhead. Jade fondly recalls how her first love - the relationship she shares with David - was everything all at once, the kind of undying love that is worth fighting for.",
  "synopsis": "The opening scene is a high school graduation, class of 2014. Jade Butterfield (Gabriella Wilde), a shy but beautiful young woman, is graduating. She is going to be attending Brown University in the fall. She stands alone after the ceremony, while everyone else laughs with friends and takes pictures together. Jade quietly rejoins her parents while reminiscing about her older brother, Chris, who passed away from cancer. David (Alex Pettyfer), another student graduating, observes her from a distance and notices how lonely she seems. He is intrigued by her, but doesn't speak to her. His best friend, Mace teases him about crushing on her for 4 years but never speaking to her and he brings up David's ex-girlfriend, Jenny.Jade, her parents, Hugh and Anne, and her older brother Keith stop at an upscale restaurant to eat lunch after the graduation. Her father pulls the car up for valet service. While exiting the car, Jade bumps into David and Mace, who work as the valets at the restaurant. She shyly says 'hello' and walks inside behind her parents, but comes outside again to ask David to sign her yearbook. Inside the restaurant, Jade's father asks her what she would like as a graduation present. Jade asks for a party. She's never had the chance to socialize with her peers before. (Its clear that Jade has lived a very sheltered, caged life after the death of her brother.) Although her mother thinks its a wonderful idea, her father thinks its a bit odd, but agrees nonetheless. Jade goes out to invite David to her party. A snobby client drives up in his fancy car and treats David and Mace rudely, so they grab Jade and go joy riding in his car. As Jade's family leaves the restaurant they observe David getting into a physical altercation with the snobby client who insulted Jade. After punching the client David gets fired on the spot.Jade wears a beautiful red dress for her graduation party. Her home is full of her father, Hugh's wealthy, middle-aged friends. None of her classmates have shown up. David arrives. Jade is happy to see him, but she feels bad that none of her classmates have come. David explains that there is another graduation party taking place the same evening and that everyone is probably there. He takes out his phone, calls the police and makes a fake noise complaint about the other party, effectively shutting it down. Soon, lots of classmates begin to arrive at Jade's house. Everyone drinks, dances and has fun. Jade and David sneak into a closet to kiss just as Jade's father gathers everyone together to make a speech. He talks about how proud he is of Jade and attempts to make a toast, however Jade is nowhere to be found. She sheepishly comes out of the closet, closely followed by David. Her father is annoyed, but continues with the toast. He thanks everyone for coming and ends his speech by asking them all to leave. David leaves after apologizing to Jade's father. He knows he's made a bad first impression but makes it clear that he cares for Jade very much.Jade races to her balcony and throws a paper plane down to David. It says, Wait until all the lights are off. David waits in the pouring rain until the lights are off. He sneaks back into the house and walks into a room where Jade is waiting for him. There's a large cozy fire in the fireplace and she's wearing a beautiful, white negligee. They begin to kiss passionately, undress and spend the night together. It's clear that Jade and David are completely smitten with each other.The next day, Jade spends time with her father at the hospital. He is a doctor and is grooming her to go into medical school. He asks her to stay and observe a surgery, but she tells him that she can't. He is disappointed and taken aback by her not following his wishes, since she usually does. She meets David near a lake and kisses him intensely. They discuss a summer medical internship she has, which means they only have about 10 days left to spend together. David tells her that he doesn't care how much time they have, he wants to enjoy it to the fullest. A very sweet montage shows them riding bicycles, running through fields and enjoying each other's company with reckless abandon. David drops Jade home after their last evening together. She tells him to ask her to stay, instead of leaving for the internship. He does, and she agrees. She goes inside and begins to unpack. When her father asks her why, she tells him she changed her mind about the internship. Her father knows its because of David. He is furious. The next morning, Jade awakes to find her entire family packing. Her father has decided to take everyone to the lake house. Jade is upset and doesn't want to go, but her father doesn't give her a choice. Shortly after they arrive at the lake house, the doorbell rings. It's David. Jade's father is not pleased, but since Keith's girlfriend is there, how can he not let Jade's boyfriend stay too? Later, Jade's father apologizes for being rude and unwelcoming to David. As they are eating breakfast a female colleague, of Hugh's shows up. Anne seems surprised that Dawn has shown up and excuses herself.That night, Jade, David, Keith and Keith's girlfriend are outside playing with fireworks. David goes into the garage to get some more. He sees Jade's father in the garage kissing Dawn. He is disturbed and leaves quickly, making sure Jade doesn't go into the garage. The next morning, Jade's father takes David out in a boat and after David confronts him, Hugh denies the indiscretion and threatens David to remain quiet if he knows what's good for him.Anne writes a recommendation letter to a colleague at University of Georgia, her alma mater, for David. She sees something special in him and thinks he will do great things. She is especially thankful for the life he has brought back to her daughter. Hugh reads the letter and promises to mail it for her.On the way to a party Keith confesses to David, Jade and girlfriend, Sabine, how inadequate he's always felt and how he's never been able to please his father. At the party Jade and David run into Mace, Jenny and other friends who convince them to sneak into a local zoo, despite David's hesitation. A friend of Mace's - Charlie - lets them into the zoo where they have tons of fun playing hide and seek, looking at different animals and riding the carousel. Jenny sees David and Jade kiss and jealously calls the police to report the break in. The police arrive and David sends Jade off with his friend, and he draws the police to chase after him instead. David gets caught and taken to jail. The others, including Jade get away. Jade is distraught and asks her father to bail David out. He shows Jade and the mom a criminal background check he had done on David. It lists an instance of \"domestic violence\" that David had with a man his mom was cheating on his dad with, in which David went to Juvenile Hall for. Jade says she doesn't care and Hugh finally agrees to get David out of jail, if Jade promises to go for the internship. Hugh bails David out of jail, but insults him by talking trash about David's family and the domestic violence incident, provoking David to punch him. He goes home to his family and tells them that David is violent, manipulative and cannot be trusted.Jade goes looking for David and finds him with Jenny in a caf\u00e9. Jealous and mistaken Jade leaves the cafe and he after chases her. They go back and forth with arguing until he walks away. She accuses him of not fighting for their relationship. She gets into her car and begins driving away. David runs after her, but she is slammed into by another car.Everyone converges together at the hospital: Jade's parents and brother and David and his father, Harry. Jade's father takes David's father aside and gives him a restraining order for David to stay 50 feet away from Jade. Harry argues that they're only kids and they just had an argument, but Hugh refuses to hear him and threatens to sue Harry for everything he has if David goes against the restraining order. When Jade gets out of the hospital she goes to see David, but his father refuses to let her see him, since it would be illegal and get him into trouble.Jade leaves for Brown while David stays in town. They each try to move on with their lives. Months go by. David runs into Jade's mother in a bookstore and asks to have coffee with her. She always admired David and his love for Jade. He asks if Jade is coming home for Christmas and if he can see her. Jade's mother tells him which day she is arriving. David goes to the airport and meets her as she walks out of a terminal. They kiss and admit they love each other. He tells her he has two tickets and will take them anywhere in the world. He asks her if she'll meet him that night and run away with him. She looks into his eyes and agrees.Hugh and Anne get in a fight while waiting for Jade at the airport. She confronts him that David never got into UGA and that she knows he never mailed her recommendation letter. She believes he's ruined David's future, and asks Hugh to look at the man he's becoming.That night, Jade's father picks a fight with Keith for being in Chris's room and playing his records. Jade's father wants to keep it like a museum. Keith and his girlfriend leave in anger. Jade's mother follows, to be with her son. Jade packs her things to leave with David. Unknown to anyone, a candle has fallen over in Chris's room and ignited a huge fire. Right as Jade and David are leaving, she sees that the house is on fire and screams for her father's safety. He is inside hastily collecting Chris's things, trying to save them. David rushes inside to save Jade's father. He is knocked down and loses consciousness. Jade's father sees him, puts down Chris's belongings and picks up David. They both make it out of the burning house.The next scene shows Jade and her mother standing at Chris's grave. It is another few months later, and it is revealed that Jade's parents are separated. Her mother encourages her to be close with her father again. Jade lets her father drop her at the airport. David meets her there and they fly to California, where they witness Keith and his girlfriend, Sabine get married.The movie ends with the four of them hanging out on the beach. Jade and David lay next to each other as her voice over explains how a certain kind of love, the intense, once-in-a-lifetime, can't-live-without-you love, is worth fighting for."
