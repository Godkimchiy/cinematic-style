  "overview": "A butterfly, a creature symbolising rebirth and a new beginning, epitomises Romina\u2019s and Germ\u00e1n\u2019s world, a world that consists of two parallel realities. In one of them they grow up as siblings who desire each other and try to give shape to their love without sexual fulfilment; in the other they are a young man and woman who form an awkward friendship instead of succumbing to their feelings for each other. Germ\u00e1n finds himself in a discordant relationship with Mariela. Mariela\u2019s brother is interested in Bruno. Bruno is with Romina, but wants to be with Germ\u00e1n. Playfully alternating between these two realities, the lovers find themselves drawn into ever new couplings in order to explore their intuitive feelings \u2013 cautiously, but at the same time prepared to lose everything.",
  "storyline": "The flapping of a butterfly divides Romina's universe into two parallel possibilities: In the first one, she is abandoned by her biological mother, and then raised by another family with German as a brother. There, destiny causes them to build a relationship of love and tension in which they are forbidden for sexual desire. In the other possible world, Romina and German know each other as friends and their permitted but clumsy relationship will alternate this story with the other reality in a game of constant possibilities.",
