  "storyline": "Set in rural Ohio, the birthplace of football, a small-town high school football team rises from obscurity to play their cross-town rival, a perennial powerhouse, while standing up for an entire community. Bobby Burkett is the promising quarterback for the Knights, but his Division Four school has never made a playoff appearance until Coach Vince DeAntonio's arrival. Their gruff new coach recruits a talented but insecure receiver and gives a juvenile delinquent offensive lineman a second chance. When Bobby falls for rival cheerleader Renee Donohue, a battle for more than a championship begins with the Viking's \"golden boy\" quarterback John Hanford III. Meanwhile, Bobby's father is being sued by his former employer and town patriarch John Hanford II over the intellectual rights to a revolutionary new energy saving product. With their home at stake, things look grim for the Burketts (until rumors of Hanford Corp's move to Mexico surface). Now with hundreds of manufacturing jobs at stake...",
  "plot": "The film begins with the narrator telling his son, Matty, a story before going to sleep, one where he will have to use his imagination.\n\nMany years ago, Jake, a timid boy and the best foosball player around, was working in a bar in a small and quiet town. He loved Laura, a girl he met in the bar, but she did not know.\n\nWhile showing Laura the foosball table, a kid named Ace arrives and challenges Jake to a game in front of Laura. Although initially the kid beats him, Jake is victorious, and everyone at the bar applauds. Outside of the bar, Ace encounters a manager who offers to take him on.\n\nSeven years later, Jake's simple routine falls apart when Ace becomes the best football player in the world, and returns to the small town to avenge the only defeat in his life.\n\nNow that he is famous, Ace announces that he has purchased the whole village and builds a gigantic football stadium, although he is more interested in owning the foosball table where he lost to Jake and destroying the bar where he was defeated. He also wants to win the affection of Laura.\n\nWith foosball, the bar and even his soul destroyed, Jake discovers something magical: in the face of adversity, the town's foosball players talk and plan. Together they embark on a journey full of adventures to save Laura. Along the way, they become a real team.",
