Once finished he heads to Portland , (reality is Seattle) where he is already being tweeted of his actions , while RoboShark's actions are being followed by a news crew , while the daughter of the reporter he follows is the very same daughters whose tweet he is following. Now the US NAVY is after RoboShark while he burrows away through rock as well as water to the delight of his tweeters. Causing damage along the way only to have a final confrontation with the Navy at the iconic symbol of Seattle, the Space Needle.",
