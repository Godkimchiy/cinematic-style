  "overview": "A group of young bio-engineers discover they can use quantum physics to transfer motor-skills between human brains.  Believing this to be a first step towards a new intellectual freedom, they freely distribute the technology. But as the mysterious past of one of their group is revealed, dark forces emerge that threaten to subvert this technology into a means of mass control.  DxM takes the mind-bender thriller to the next level with an immersive narrative and breath-taking action.",
  "storyline": "A group of brilliant young students discover the greatest scientific breakthrough of all time: a wireless neural network, connected via a quantum computer, capable of linking the minds of each and every one of us. They realise that quantum theory can be used to transfer motor-skills from one brain to another, a first shareware for human motor-skills. They freely spread this technology, believing it to be a first step towards a new equality and intellectual freedom. But they soon discover that they themselves are part of a much greater and more sinister experiment as dark forces emerge that threaten to subvert this technology into a means of mass-control. MindGamers takes the mind-bender thriller to the next level with an immersive narrative and breath-taking action.",
