  "overview": "Tired of her bland marriage, Emma moves in with her son Elliot in his downtown LA loft. Elliot is a chef at a lackluster Chinese restaurant facing foreclosure. Also he\u2019s gay \u2013 and Emma\u2019s distaste and denial over this has made strangers of mother and son.  But now, as Emma indulges herself with the encouragement of a saucy new friend, and Elliot confronts his fears of intimacy, mother and son find ways to communicate with food where words fail. Stars Sharon Omi, Teddy Chen Culver, Nicole Sullivan (MADtv) and a surprise moment with George Takei.",
  "storyline": "Emma only knows one way how to add spice to her life... by squirting it from a bottle of hot sauce. The rest of her life is cushy but bland: scrambled egg whites, decaffeinated coffee and her husband, Ray. She's had enough and runs away from home. Her estranged son, Elliot, finds her lurking outside his restaurant with suitcase in hand. They try to start over again as mother and son in this odd-couple living situation, but she's old-fashioned, and he's gay. Between them are years of awkward moments and unspoken tensions. Feeling lonely, Emma accidentally befriends the lady next door who's so eccentric that Emma's way over her head. Meanwhile, a passionate encounter with a man in a bar turns Elliot's fear of commitment on its head. With dumplings, dessert, whiskey, and even Ecstasy in front of them, will they give in to their indulgences? And can mother and son reconcile while struggling to discover their own appetites for life?",
  "plot": "A Brooklyn garage band, General Malacarne, survives a radioactive event and have to battle against zombies to what they believe is the safe haven of Long Island.",
