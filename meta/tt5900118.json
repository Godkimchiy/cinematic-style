  "overview": "Kismath (English: Destiny) is a 2016 Indian Malayalam romantic drama film written and directed by debutante Shanavas K Bavakkutty. It stars Shane Nigam and Shruty Menon as two star-crossed lovers from different religious backgrounds. It is produced by Shailaja Manikandan under the banner of Pattam Cinema Company, and in association with LJ FIlms and Akbar Travels.  The film narrates the real-life story of a Ponnani couple - a 28-year-old scheduled caste woman and a 23-year-old Muslim man - who faced backlash from society for their relationship in 2011.",
  "storyline": "The friendship between B.Tech student Irfan and research student Anitha and the lives around them form the plot of the film. Various incidents that take place in one day are narrated in the movie.",
  "plot": "Tony (Bobby Deol), works as a hit-man for gangster, Vikas Patil (Ashish Vidyarthi), who owes his allegiance to wealthy Raj Mallya (Kabir Bedi). Raj Mallya is involved in marketing spurious and out-dated drugs, and as a result is the subject of an investigation by the Food &amp; Drugs Administration's inspector Dr. Hargobind Gosai (Mohan Joshi). Raj asks Vikas to take care of Hargobind through Tony, which Tony does, and in this manner, Raj is absolved of all wrongdoing. Then Tony meets with attractive starlet named, Sapna (Priyanka Chopra), and falls head over heels in love with her. When Sapna tells him that she is engaged to be married to Dr. Ajay Saxena, he is heart-broken. Then a scandal breaks out, and Hargobind is implicated in the deaths of three children that were killed by Raj's spurious drugs. All the evidence points against Hargobind, and not a single lawyer is willing to take his case; his wife kills herself, and the marriage of his daughter has been canceled. Then Tony finds out that Hargobind is none other than Sapna's dad&#160;\u2013 and he has ruined the only chance he had for marrying the girl of his dreams. This movie has since then gained a cult status due to its gripping story &amp; direction; and is a big hit on TV.",
