Maruska\u2019s neighbor and best friend is constantly struggling with his headstrong mother as she refuses to accept that her son is gay. She blames everyone else - even her husband - for her son's \"deviation.\" The fate of all main characters is unexpectedly intertwined and told through humorous and touching situations laced with subtle irony and hyperbole.
