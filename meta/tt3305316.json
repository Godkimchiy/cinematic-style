  "overview": "Detectives and best friends Andreas and Simon lead vastly different lives; Andreas has settled down with his beautiful wife and son; while Simon, recently divorced, spends most of his waking hours getting drunk at the local strip club. But all that changes when the two of them are called out to a domestic dispute between a junkie couple, caught in a vicious cycle of violence and drugs. It all looks very routine \u2013 until Andreas finds the couple's infant son, crying in a closet. The usually collected policeman finds himself confronted with his own powerlessness and is shaken to his core. As Andreas slowly loses his grip on justice, it suddenly becomes up to the unruly Simon to restore the balance between right and wrong.",
  "storyline": "How far would decent human beings be willing to go, when tragedy blurs the line between just and unjust? With \"A Second Chance\", Susanne Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen have crafted another startling yet moving drama about how easily we lose our grasp on justice, when confronted with the unthinkable, and life as we know it is hanging by a thread.",
  "plot": "Two police officers, Andreas and Simon, live very different lives. Where Andreas enjoys life with his beautiful wife and newborn child, Simon calms his pain from a broken marriage by going to strip clubs and getting drunk. A routine task takes an unexpected turn when they are called out to the home of a junkie-couple where Andreas finds a neglected baby. A family tragedy, the loss of their child, forces the otherwise upstanding Andreas to commit an act that sends him heading for the abyss, and leaves it up to Simon to rectify the situation.",
  "synopsis": "A Second Chance is a chilling, yet affecting drama about real people forced into incredible circumstances; a film that confronts our core notions about right and wrong, and those of us who think they can tell the difference; a film that forces us to ask: who are we to think we are better than anyone else?\nAndreas, a promising young detective, has a lot on his plate. At home, he and his wife, Anne, struggle with their new-born son, who spends every waking hour crying. At work, meanwhile, Andreas struggles to rein in his newly divorced partner Simon, who spends most of his time in strip clubs, drunkenly looking for a fight.\nOne day Andreas and Simon are called out to a domestic disturbance. There they find Tristan, a drug dealer who has a history of violence with which Andreas is only too familiar and who has now resorted to taking his own drugs and forcing his girlfriend, Sanne, to do the same. When Andreas and Simon intervene in the couples bickering, they witness a shocking instance of neglect that sends a livid Andreas into his little familys warm embrace.\nThen, one night, the unthinkable happens and the little family is struck by sudden tragedy. When Andreas sees his life unravelling, he makes a choice that will lead himself and everyone he knows down a rabbit hole of moral and ethical disarray. As Andreas begins to blur the lines between right and wrong, just and unjust, it falls upon the chaotic Simon to restore the order."
