  "overview": "A young man at the end of his life tries to find hope and meaning through the relationships he will leave behind.",
  "storyline": "The mental and emotional trials of a young man suffering from terminal cancer, and the loved ones he will ultimately leave behind. The dynamics of love earned, life to be lived, and dreams shattered are explored as the strength of a few is tested in a very real story about letting go. \"Only when you learn to let go, does the beauty of life and everything in it reveal itself.\"",
  "plot": "Mexican filmmaker Sebasti\u00e1n (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) and his executive producer Costa (Luis Tosar) arrive in Cochabamba, Bolivia, accompanied by a cast and crew, prepared to create a historical film depicting Christopher Columbus's first voyage to the New World, the imposition of Columbus\u2019 will upon the natives, and the subsequent indigenous rebellion by Hatuey. Cognizant of his limited budget, Costa elects to film in Bolivia, the poorest country in South America. There, impoverished locals are thrilled to earn just two dollars a day as extras in the film, and willingly engage in physical labor for set preparation. Costa saves many thousands of dollars by having underpaid extras perform tasks meant to be completed by experienced engineers.\n\nSebasti\u00e1n casts a local man named Daniel (Juan Carlos Aduviri) in the role of Atuey, the Ta\u00edno chief who led a rebellion against Columbus; and Daniel's daughter Bel\u00e9n in a crucial role as well. Their first encounter with Daniel gives Costa pause and causes him to oppose his casting, but Sebastian gives him the role. Sebastian is unaware that fictional actor Daniel is leading demonstrations against the historically real event of water privatization that the Bolivian government has agreed to. Filming begins smoothly despite the alcoholism of actor Anton, (Karra Elejalde) cast as Col\u00f3n (Columbus), but when Costa observes Daniel\u2019s revolutionary involvement, he grows uneasy.\n\nDaniel pretends to acquiesce to Costa's insistence that he stop protesting, but heedlessly continues and sustains facial wounds in a clash with the police. At this point, Costa bribes Daniel to wait for filming to conclude before participating in the rebellion again. Daniel agrees, accepting the money, but spends it on funding the protesters and remains involved, eventually becoming bloodied and imprisoned. Sebasti\u00e1n experiences moral conflict and begins to doubt the likelihood of the film\u2019s completion, but is reassured by Costa, who bribes the police for Daniel\u2019s temporary release in order to film a key scene. Upon this scene\u2019s completion, police arrive in the Bolivian jungle to once again detain Daniel but are besieged by the film\u2019s extras, aiding Daniel's escape.\n\nThat night, when actors Juan and Alberto see the latest news reports showing violence in Cochabamba, they become worried to the extent that they demand to leave. Sebasti\u00e1n begs that they stay and they hesitantly agree. The next day, as the cast and crew prepare to depart for filming, Costa is met by Daniel\u2019s wife, Teresa, who desperately implores him to assist her in finding her daughter Bel\u00e9n, who has disappeared into the protests and is reportedly wounded and needing hospitalization. Teresa\u2019s persistence wins over Costa\u2019s conscience, and despite Sebasti\u00e1n's equally impassioned insistence against it, he leaves with her.\n\nAfter Costa and Teresa's obstacle-laden drive through riotous Cochabamba, Bel\u00e9n\u2019s life is saved, but her leg is badly injured and may never fully heal. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew is stopped by a military blockade and all except Ant\u00f3n leave Sebasti\u00e1n to journey home. The revolution ends shortly thereafter with the departure of the multinational water company, but Cochabamba is left in ruins from the conflict. Costa expresses hope that the film will be finished after all, and Daniel emotionally presents him with a vial of Bolivian water in appreciation for his life-saving efforts.",
