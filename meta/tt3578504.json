  "overview": "Korengal picks up where Restrepo left off; the same men, the same valley, the same commanders, but a very different look at the experience of war.",
  "storyline": "Picks up where Restrepo left off. Once again we meet the men of Battle Company, 2nd Battalion, 503nd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team in 2007-8. They are deployed at one of the most dangerous places on earth - certainly the most dangerous place, at the time, for US forces: the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan. Journalist Sebastian Junger and photojournalist Tim Hetherington were embedded with the 2nd Platoon of B Company and captured their daily lives.",
  "plot": "The documentary takes place between 2007 and 2008 in the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan. The film consists mainly of interviews with men in a platoon stationed at outpost Restrepo. Forty-two soldiers died in Korengal Valley before the United States pulled out in April 2010. Unlike Restrepo, which was a film mostly about battle, Korengal examines the military life and experiences of those same men. The men are filmed in extreme closeup as they are interviewed; they express the most intense fear and exhilaration they ever experienced while in combat. They express bonds between each other that go beyond the intensity of their own family ties. One soldier states that he would gladly die for one of his fellow soldiers.\n\nWhereas Restrepo showed the \"high\" of combat, Korengal expresses more bitterness. Many of the soldiers interviewed after their deployment missed the camaraderie of the other men, missed the adrenaline of war, and the excitement of \"cheating death.\" One soldier expressed this simply as \"I'd go back there if I could.\"",
