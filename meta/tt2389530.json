  "overview": "David Sieveking left home years ago to make films. Now he has returned \u2013 and for a reason: To help his mother, Gretel, who has Alzheimer\u2019s, and relieve her long-time carer and his father Malte for a few weeks. The filmmaker takes on the role of carer and documents this encounter with his camera. Gretel no longer knows the people around her, but her puns and charm have not faded. The time spent with his mother becomes a journey into David\u2019s unexpected family history. Once active in Zurich\u2019s left-wing scene, David\u2019s parents enjoyed a lifelong \u201copen relationship\u201d, characterised by a loving distance and mutual respect. VERGISS MEIN NICHT is a film about dementia, but it\u2019s first and foremost a declaration of a love of life and family.",
  "storyline": "Filmmaker David Sieveking portays the home care of his mother who, like 2 million other people in Germany, suffers from Alzheimer's Disease. David's parents had been a part of the student movement in the sixties and led an open relationship, which is now put to the test dramatically by the disease. The whole family has to deal with the smoldering conflicts to find a new solidarity.",
