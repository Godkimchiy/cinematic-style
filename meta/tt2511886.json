  "overview": "Lauren and her younger brother Harvey risk being taken into care when their grandmother, who is their legal guardian, becomes ill. Lauren accepts the offer of a scholarship to a prestigious sports academy on the understanding that she and Harvey stay together while living with Janice, her duplicitous and ambitious agent. It soon becomes clear that there are plans to split the pair up; when Harvey runs away to find their long-lost grandfather, who hasn\u2019t been heard from for years, Lauren follows. En route the pair discover that, despite all their differences, when they are side by side they are strong enough to deal with anything. This beautifully shot British debut is part family drama, part coming of age story and a road trip that nods towards some of the greats of children\u2019s literature. The young leads give compelling and moving performances that make for an emphatically British family film that\u2019s refreshingly free of even the hint of a franchise. (Source: LFF programme)",
  "storyline": "Side by Side explores, with refreshing honesty, the unique bond between a brother and a sister. Facing the rest of their childhood apart, they runaway in search of the only person who can keep their family together.",
