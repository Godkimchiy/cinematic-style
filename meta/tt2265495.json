  "overview": "It was to be the greatest animated film of all time. Not just an eye-opener, but a game-changer. Richard Williams demanded nothing less, investing nearly three decades into his movie masterpiece. From as early as 1964 he ploughed most of the profits right back into his pet project, a feature inspired by the Arabian Nights and provisionally known as Mullah Nasruddin. He assembled a team of inspired young artists\u2014and brought in the best Hollywood craftsmen to teach them\u2014and devised what would be the most elaborate, kaleidoscopic, mind-boggling visual sequences ever committed to celluloid. Years passed. Potential financiers came and went. Work continued. But it was only after Roger Rabbit that Williams had a studio budget to corroborate the munificence of his imagination.",
  "storyline": "Striving to make the greatest animated film of all time, visionary animator Richard Williams ('Who Framed Roger Rabbit') toiled for more than a quarter century on his masterpiece - only to have it torn from his hands. Filmmaker Kevin Schreck has woven together mind-blowing animation, rare archival footage, and exclusive interviews with key animators and artists who worked with Williams on his ill-fated magnum opus to bring this legendary story to the screen. A tale of creative genius gone horribly awry, PERSISTENCE OF VISION is the untold story of the greatest animated film never made.",
  "plot": "Animator Richard Williams attempts to finish his masterpiece, a long-term vanity project called The Thief and the Cobbler. Though he did not participate in the making of the film, archival footage of Williams is combined with interviews with his co-workers.",
