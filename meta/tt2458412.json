  "overview": "Oft-nude blog star Elenore is winding her way through the power dynamics of a relationship with a powerful business woman when she meets Eugene, a married office drone. The two begin a peculiar pseudo-sexual relationship wrought with role playing and cloaked in a form of semi-anonymity that can only come from digitally-born casual relationships.",
  "storyline": "Elenore is a young woman in New York City who makes a living as an on-line Internet sex sensation by taking sensual and nude selfie photos of herself and posting them on her Craigslist blog for paying viewers. She is currently involved with two people. She is dating a wealthy career woman, named Dee, who wants a commitment from her. Eleanor also has a turbulent sexual relationship with Eugene, an older married man she met on-line who makes frequent visits to her small apartment to roll-play in various acts to revive his non-existent sex life. Elenore soon gets so caught up in her roll-playing romance with Eugene that the line between fantasy and reality becomes blurred to a point of uncertainty.",
