  "overview": "On the edge of a crumbling city, 11-year-old Alexander lives in a sequestered commune alongside other children, their mothers, and charismatic leader, Gregori. Gregori teaches the children how to raise livestock, grow vegetables, work as a community - and how to kill. With the birth of a new baby brother weighing on his mind, Alexander begins to question Gregori\u2019s overpowering influence on the children and their training to become assassins. Threatened by his increasing unwillingness to fall in line, Gregori\u2019s behavior turns erratic and adversarial toward the child he once considered a son. With the two set dangerously at odds and the commune\u2019s way of life disintegrating, the residents fear a violent resolution is at hand.",
  "storyline": "Alexander, a boy who has been raised in a sequestered commune, finds that his increasing unwillingness to fall in line puts him on a collision course with Gregori, the society's charismatic and domineering leader.",
  "plot": "Gregori, who operates a child assassin patriarch, adopts Alexander after seeing his mother, Susanna, without a partner at a hospital. Eleven years later, Alexander is an adept assassin running missions with other future child assassins adopted in the same manner. Gregori tells the children the world is full of terrible men which is why they must carry out their missions. Gregori teaches the children to put earplugs in during assassinations to protect their ears from the gunshot.\n\nLeo, Alexander's friend, is critical of himself after a mock assassination. Gregori sends Alexander and a girl on a mission where he kills a mechanic. Alexander sees his mother crying due to pregnancy, after she drops a piece of meat. He goes out during a mission and buys new meat at a local grocery store. The owner treats him kindly and gives him chocolate. Leo begins to question Gregori's authority escalating to a confrontation after Leo witnesses a chicken being slaughtered. He compares the chicken to the tyrannosaurus rex, fearing its extinction. Leo disappears from the compound afterwards. Alexander begins to question everything he was taught. Susanna gives birth to a baby brother named Tobias. On Alexander's third mission he shoots a man and watches his blood pour out. On his way back he meets a boy who plays with his gun before returning it to him. Alexander takes Tobias after coming home. He is confronted by Gregori as the camera pans down Alexander is seen holding his gun pointed at Gregori with earplugs in Tobias' ears.",
  "synopsis": "A tangled story about a man who, in first light, seems to save battered women and abused children - bringing them to a private enclave to live free of fear albeit in a strange communal system with only the mothers, the children and one man. As the story progresses, we see how fragile this man's ego is within some of his encounters when a child challenges him. One of his biggest challengers is a young man he saved the day he was born - which brings a nice ironic twist to the plot. I'm curious to find out if the mothers know about the daytime sorties he has them going on........The final line is prophetic"
