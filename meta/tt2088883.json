  "overview": "\u201cRising from Ashes\u201d is a feature length documentary about the \ufb01rst Rwandan National Cycling Team and their six year journey to the Olympic games in London. It's not about the bike. It's about second chances, how our past doesn't have to de\ufb01ne our future, and the impossible triumph of the human spirit over one of the world's most devastating genocides.",
  "storyline": "Rising from Ashes is a feature length documentary about the first Rwandan national cycling team in their bid to make history and represent their country at the 2012 Olympics. Competing in a white man's sport, reserved for the privileged, a rag tag group of cyclists coached by the first American to ride in the Tour de France, are transformed into a powerful symbol of hope for a country recovering from one of the world's most devastating genocides.",
  "plot": "Professional cyclist Jacques \u201cJock\u201d Boyer moves to Rwanda in 2006 to help a group of struggling genocide survivors working to form a national cycling team. The team is composed of children left orphaned and traumatized by the genocide a decade earlier. Over the course of the story, both Boyer and the team \"rise from the ashes\" of their pasts with the help of their new achievements.\n\n\"Team Rwanda\" begins as a cycling organization but evolves as organizers realize the athletes' greater needs. Many riders are illiterate and malnourished, living without water, electricity or healthcare, and most are recovering from the psychological effects of the 1994 genocide. Eventually, \"Team Rwanda\" is viewed as a symbol of hope for Rwanda, ambassadors for the recovering country. In subsequent years, the team expands its vision and develops a model of caring for athletes. In 2012, the team begins developing the first all-African team to match up to the Tour de France after one of the riders qualifies for the 2012 Summer Olympics.",
