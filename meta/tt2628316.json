  "plot": "Danny Harvey was once the leader of the Green Street Elite, a group of hooligans supporting their beloved West Ham United. However, grown tired of the lifestyle, he leaves home and sets up shop as a mixed martial arts gym owner in Northern Ireland. After being confronted by some Irish goons for some protection money, Danny beats the goons up and tells them if their boss ever sends them again, he will find him and handle it. Danny's new life is shattered when he learns his younger brother Joey has been killed in a hooligan match.\n\nReturning home, Danny meets up with Victor, an old friend who has since become a policeman. Victor tells Danny not to get involved and that he will handle the manner of Joey's death. When Danny goes to the Abbey, the local pub the Green Street Elite hang out at, he finds himself infatuated with barkeep Molly and meets up with GSE members Gilly and Big John. Danny wants answers as to who killed Joey. When they tell him that Joey had become somewhat of a rebel hooligan and challenged the wrong team out of spite, he was killed. Danny decides to rejoin the GSE much to the chagrin on Victor. However, Victor and Danny make a deal to cooperate with each other to find out who killed Joey, but they keep it on the down low.\n\nDanny soon learns that the rules of hooliganism has changed. He learns the hard way when he arrives with the GSE at a game between West Ham and Tottenham. He breaks a bottle over a Tottenham hooligan's head and is arrested, only to be let go a few miles from the arena. When Gilly informs Danny of the new rules, a fight breaks out outside the Abbey between the GSE and Tottenham hooligans. Danny learns that there are now organized fights between hooligans, in teams of five. Danny decides to use his knowledge of mixed martial arts to train the members of the GSE for the organized fights. Meanwhile, as Victor continues his investigation of Joey's death, he is constantly finding himself being harassed by his superior.\n\nDanny and the GSE one day sees the Millwall team, led by the towering Mason. As Millwall easily destroys their opponents, Mason taunts Danny about Joey on numerous occasions. With a tournament between the teams happening, Danny continues to train the GSE and soon, the GSE begin to take out the competition. As they rise in the rankings, Mason begins to see the GSE as a potential threat. Meanwhile, when Molly catches Danny talking with Victor, she confronts him.
