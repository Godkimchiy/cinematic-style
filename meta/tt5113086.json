  "overview": "The residents of a small town discover that something more sinister than killer wolves is lurking in the backwoods: first the wolves start turning up dead...then people.",
  "storyline": "For years, the old woman in the woods has secretly kept the wolves of the forest at bay. But when the woman dies, the creatures suddenly attack the residents of a nearby small town. As more and more people turn up dead, the townsfolk discover something far more sinister than wolves lurking in the backwoods and fight to save their home from evil by waging a bloody battle against the ruthless creatures. But as the wolves begin to overpower the town, only the woman's granddaughter may have the key to stopping the bloodbath before it's too late.",
  "plot": "The film takes place in the United States in what is presumably the present day. A large, colossal asteroid the size of Texas (roughly 600 miles (970&#160;km) in diameter) is heading towards the Earth, and threatens to wipe out the human race in a manner similar to the extinction of the dinosaurs.\n\nWhilst the Earth begins a series of efforts to divert and later destroy the asteroid, two parents \u2013 Jason (Rhett Giles) and Ashley (Jill Stapley) \u2013 search for their missing child, who is in Los Angeles, while attempting to overcome various catastrophes somehow triggered by the arrival of the meteorite.\n\nJason and Ashley eventually realize that it is not advanced technology that is required to find their child or divert the asteroid but faith in religion. The daughter is eventually reunited with her father, just at the time the asteroid is about to hit. They tell each other that they will see each other soon, and the film ends with the asteroid colliding with the Earth, destroying all life.",
