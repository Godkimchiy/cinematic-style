  "overview": "Love Me follows Western men and Ukrainian women as they embark on an unpredictable and riveting journey in search of love through the modern \"mail-order bride\" industry.",

The film highlights the complete process of finding a partner in a foreign land, showing the Western male and Ukrainian female perspectives.",
  "plot": "In so few minutes, Love Me Haiti mirrors 21st century geo-political corruption at its best. The film does it suspensefully by presenting the life of a couple: two doctors who naively think humanitarian medicine is about treating those in needs, having divine faith and hoping for a cure but soon find themselves fighting something beyond belief - a criminal injustice system in a decaying world.\n\nIn simple words, the film twistfully illustrates how life is a bitch.",
