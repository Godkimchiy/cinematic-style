  "overview": "New John L'Ecuyer movie",
  "storyline": "When Jack gets rescued by Maria, a superstitious Portuguese beauty, he has no idea that his life and luck are both about to change. During this accidental \"first date\", Jack and Maria project idealistic images of themselves -- images that are humorously contradicted through a series of flash-forwards to their future life together.",
  "plot": "Shemp wins $50,000 for accidentally guessing the correct make of a car for a radio contest. The boys check in at the Hotel Costa Plente, and quickly spend their winnings. Their suite is furnished with many expensive items, which they systematically destroy. The hotel manager (Vernon Dent) discovers the destruction when he delivers a telegram to the stooges' suite; the telegram reveals that taxes withheld from Shemp's winnings reduce the $50,000 windfall to a minuscule $4.85.\n\nJust then, three attractive gold diggers (Nanette Bordeaux, Vivian Mason, Suzanne Ridgeway), who are also guests at the hotel, connive their way into the boys' room. After twice being accidentally drenched with ice water thrown by the boys, the girls hit the stooges over the head with champagne bottles.",
