  "overview": "The American composer and author Paul Bowles was a man with a great deal of charisma and influence. When he moved to Tangier, Morocco, in 1949, half the world followed him to the enigmatic city. His marriage with author Jane Bowles was a loving relationship of opposites, even though both were homosexual. Based on exclusive interviews with Bowles shortly before his death interwoven with anecdotes recounted by his friends and co-workers, the film portrays a daring and visionary life as well as a relationship shaped by an interdependency that encompassed much more than sexuality.",
  "storyline": "'Paul Bowles: The Cage Door is Always Open' tells the story of writer and composer Paul Bowles and his wife Jane. They married in New York in 1937, and although they both had homosexual affairs, they maintained an intense devotion to each other that led them on a spiritual journey to Tangier, Moroco--the point of no return.",
