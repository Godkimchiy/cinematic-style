For years, the Black Tiger\u2019s fearsome boss Lei Gong played by Sammo Hung has been trying to get rid of the leader of the Northern Sea. One of his latest recruits is Wong Fei Hung, a fearless fighter who takes the Northern Sea leader\u2019s head after a fierce fight. Recognizing Fei\u2019s talent, Lei Gong makes the young warrior his godson and one of his Four Tigers, the most trusted men in the gang. There is more to young Fei than meets the eye and the truth about his past and the ultimate showdown soon unravels.",
