Add these three heartsick ladies plus one bound & unrepentant man to the hot desert and watch them sizzle on screen. Things take a gut-wrenching turn when Rihanna must decide once and for all what to do with her \"Chris\". The film set in the picturesque landscapes of California - Joshua Tree and Malibu. Lodric D.
