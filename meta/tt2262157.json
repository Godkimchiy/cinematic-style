  "plot": "The film is a coming of age story, between a live-in babysitter with a 12-year-old skeptical prodigy.\n\nIn Brooklyn, 23-year-old Eleanor (Leighton Meester) breaks up with her failing and disloyal musician boyfriend, Dennis (Billie Joe Armstrong). She has to move out of Dennis' apartment and crash at a friend's place. Unfortunately, Dennis refuses to let her go and confronts her at her work; Dennis' tirade costs Eleanor her job. Eleanor tries to seek family support, but her family isn't willing to help. She crashes at her friend's place one last time before seeking a temporary job.\n\nIn the Upper West Side lives Reggie, a cellist and all-round genius who's bored and skeptical. He lives a solitary life as his parents don't have time for him and relegates caretakers to watch after him. His most recent caretaker had to go back to Panama and Reggie's mother, Barbara, posts an ad for a temporary sitter; Eleanor answers the call.\n\nDespite being a genius, Reggie is treated like a child. He does his best to get around his mother's arrangements by bribing the people in his life to spread the idea that he's obedient. Upon meeting him, Eleanor is touched to hear Reggie's composition Like Sunday, Like Rain and the two strike an unlikely friendship. As summer camp approaches, Eleanor tries to get Reggie to go, but he blows it off to hang in the city for the next six weeks. In this time Dennis stalks Eleanor, wishing to talk and get back together. However, Eleanor makes it clear that they are broken up; Dennis promises to get back at her for breaking his guitar, but he never returns.\n\nLater, while hanging at the park, Reggie becomes more fascinated with Eleanor. Eleanor's father is terminally ill and she has to go upstate to see him. Eleanor originally plans go away a few days, but Reggie suggests he go with her and they travel together to her hometown. Back in her hometown Reggie gets to see Eleanor's life and her dysfunctional family.\n\nEleanor's sister works at a seedy bar, while her mother and uncle are care-free about Eleanor's father and didn't bother to mention his poor health until seeing her. Looking after Reggie's interest and unable to stand the situation at home, Eleanor takes him to a hotel to have some peace and quiet. There Eleanor tells Reggie how she met Dennis, the messy relations with her family, and that she nearly went to Juilliard to study the cornet. Reggie is intrigued that Eleanor can play \u2014 she explains she wanted to play the trumpet, but couldn't and chose the cornet instead; she never made it to Juilliard due to lack of funds. Before they go to sleep, Reggie promises to write a cornet piece to include Eleanor in his single.\n\nThe following day, Eleanor visits her father and Reggie can only watch from a distance, seeing Eleanor become very emotional. Dropping off the car she borrowed from her uncle, she is enraged at how he could be so nonchalant about the illness of his brother. Her uncle and mother become defensive over the matter and Eleanor storms out, declaring she would never return and escorts Reggie back home.\n\nThe summer is nearly gone and Reggie has formed a close bond with Eleanor, but it's almost time for her to leave. Her job is only temporary and another sitter has arrived to take over; Reggie has trouble accepting Eleanor's departure and wants her to stay. Eleanor feels the need to regroup at home and get her life back in order. They promise to stay in touch with each other and emotionally embrace. Eleanor kisses Reggie lightly and bids him farewell. Reggie resumes his lonely, privileged life, with Eleanor on his mind. On the doorstep of Eleanor's family home, Reggie arranges a gift for her: a cornet with the revised notes to Like Sunday, Like Rain. Reggie resumes playing the cello and, at a distance, Eleanor plays her part.",
