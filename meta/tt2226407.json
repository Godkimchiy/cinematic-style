  "overview": "This story is about two construction-workers, the brothers Cosimo (Valerio Mastandrea) and Elia (Elio Germano), who are hired by the famous singer, Fausto Mieli (Gianni Morandi), to do some work on his rural mansion, before he's due to make his big career comeback-concert in his home city. It all seems like an easy enough job, but when the brothers get there, they become the talk of the town, because they are foreign out-of-towners, and the small community doesn't like strangers. Things get even worse, when Elia notices a dead wolf in the back of a van belonging to a gang of local poachers, and tells Fausto about it.",

  "plot": "God and Lucifer have a standing wager for the souls of all mankind. Angels and demons are forbidden to manifest on Earth, but they are allowed to possess and influence humans, with human-angel and human-demon half-breeds used to peddle influence. Exorcist John Constantine was born with the power to see angels and demons. At age 15, he committed suicide to escape his visions, but he was revived after spending two minutes in Hell, though Constantine explains that since time moves differently in Hell, two minutes feels like a full lifetime. His soul is still destined for Hell for the sin of taking his own life.\n\nConstantine exorcises a girl possessed by a soldier demon trying to break through to Earth, something that should not be possible under the rules of the wager. Constantine meets with the androgynous half-breed angel Gabriel. He asks Gabriel for a reprieve from his impending death from lung cancer; but Gabriel declines, telling Constantine that his motives for exorcising demons are selfish and will not earn him entry into Heaven.\n\nConstantine repels an attack by a full demon. This encounter prompts him to meet with former witch doctor Papa Midnite, who reminds him that Constantine is the one soul that Lucifer would come to Earth to personally collect. When half-breed demon Balthazar arrives, Midnite refuses to let them fight on his neutral ground.\n\nConstantine begins investigating the situation with his associates Beeman, Hennessy, and Chas Kramer. Detective Angela Dodson shows up at Constantine's apartment to ask for his help investigating the death of Isabel, her identical twin. Isabel leapt from the top of a psychiatric hospital, where she was a patient, but Angela is convinced that Isabel would never commit suicide. Constantine agrees to help only after saving Angela from demons that attack her outside his building.\n\nWanting to see if Isabel is truly in Hell, Constantine uses her cat as a conduit to briefly transport himself there, finding Isabel damned to eternally relive the moment of her death. Meanwhile, Hennessy and Beeman have deduced that it is Lucifer's son, Mammon, who is sending demons to Earth, planning to claim it as his own kingdom. To do so, Mammon requires a powerful psychic and assistance from God.\n\nAngela reveals that she and Isabel possessed the same gift as Constantine. Angela rejected her visions and they eventually stopped, but Isabel embraced them and was institutionalized for it. Constantine reawakens Angela's psychic ability through a near death experience. They hunt down and interrogate Balthazar, who reveals that Mammon has obtained the Spear of Destiny, which is stained with the blood of Jesus Christ \u2013 which can be used as the assistance from God. Angela, who has become the psychic Mammon requires, is abducted by an invisible entity and brought to the hospital where Isabel died. Constantine convinces Midnite that the rules of the wager have been broken and asks to use \"The Chair\": an old electric chair from Sing Sing. The Chair shows Constantine how the spear was discovered in the ruins of a Nazi base in Mexico and brought to Los Angeles. Constantine and Chas rush to the hospital, but Chas is beaten to death by the invisible entity.\n\nUsing incantations and sigils tattooed on his arms, Constantine forces the invisible entity to reveal itself. It is Gabriel, who laments God\u2019s favoritism towards humans and believes bringing Hell to Earth will enable any survivors to become worthy of God\u2019s love through suffering, repentance and faith. Gabriel casts Constantine from the room and moves to stab Angela with the Spear and release Mammon, but Constantine slits his wrists and dies. Time stops as Lucifer arrives to collect his soul and Constantine tells him about Mammon\u2019s plan to usurp him. Gabriel attempts to smite Lucifer but God has taken away Gabriel's power, allowing Lucifer to burn Gabriel's wings. Lucifer sends Mammon back to Hell. In return for his help, Lucifer grants Constantine a favor; he uses it for Isabel, asking that she be released to Heaven. Lucifer then finds that he is unable to drag Constantine to Hell; nobly sacrificing the favor has granted him entry to Heaven. Infuriated, Lucifer removes Constantine's cancer and resurrects him before he reaches Heaven, claiming that keeping Constantine on Earth will ensure that he will eventually prove he belongs in Hell. Angela and Constantine depart, leaving behind the now human Gabriel.\n\nConstantine gifts the Spear to Angela, asking her to hide it somewhere not even he can find. In a post-credits scene, Constantine visits Chas' grave, where Chas appears as an angel and flies into the sky.",
