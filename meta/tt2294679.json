  "overview": "Vilified by some and venerated by others as the FBI informant largely responsible for the imprisonment of two youths following the 2008 Republican National Convention, Darby was once a charismatic activist mythologized by the American Left for his daredevil aid work in New Orleans\u2019 Ninth Ward in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Informant meticulously constructs a portrait of his life\u2014before and after the death threats\u2014through intimate interviews with Darby and tense reenactments starring the man himself.",
  "storyline": "A documentary on radical left-wing activist turned FBI informant, Brandon Darby.",
  "plot": "Mark Whitacre, a rising star at Decatur, Illinois, based Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) in the early 1990s, blows the whistle on the company\u2019s price-fixing tactics at the urging of his wife Ginger.\n\nOne night in November 1992, Whitacre confesses to FBI special agent Brian Shepard that ADM executives\u2014including Whitacre himself\u2014had routinely met with competitors to fix the price of lysine, an additive used in the commercial livestock industry. Whitacre secretly gathers hundreds of hours of video and audio over several years to present to the FBI. He assists in gathering evidence by clandestinely taping the company\u2019s activity in business meetings at various locations around the globe such as Tokyo, Paris, Mexico City, and Hong Kong, eventually collecting enough evidence of collaboration and conspiracy to warrant a raid of ADM.\n\nWhitacre\u2019s good deed dovetails with his own major infractions, while his internal, secret struggle with bipolar disorder seems to take over his exploits. The bulk of the film focuses on Whitacre's meltdown resulting from the pressures of wearing a wire and organizing surveillance for the FBI for three years, instigated by Whitacre's reaction, in increasingly manic overlays, to various trivial magazine articles he reads. In a stunning turn of events immediately following the covert portion of the case, headlines around the world report Whitacre had embezzled $9 million from his own company during the same period of time he was secretly working with the FBI and taping his co-workers, while simultaneously aiming to be elected as ADM CEO following the arrest and conviction of the remaining upper management members. In the ensuing chaos, Whitacre appears to shift his trust and randomly destabilize his relationships with Special Agents Shepard and Herndon and numerous attorneys in the process.\n\nAuthorities at ADM begin investigating the forged papertrail Whitacre had built to cover his own deeds. After being confronted with evidence of his fraud, Whitacre's defensive claims begin to spiral out of control, including an accusation of assault and battery against Agent Shepard and the FBI, which had made a substantial move to distance their case from Whitacre entirely. Because of this major infraction and Whitacre\u2019s bizarre behavior, he is sentenced to a prison term three times as long as that meted out to the white-collar criminals he helped to catch. In the epilogue, Agent Herndon visits Whitacre in prison as he videotapes a futile appeal to seek a presidential pardon. Overweight, balding and psychologically beaten after his years long ordeal, Whitacre is eventually released from prison, with his wife Ginger waiting to greet him.",
  "synopsis": "In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Brandon Darby developed a reputation as a bold and effective activist and founding member of the relief organization Common Ground. Darby was the type of guy who would heroically and single-handedly brave toxic floodwaters to rescue a stranded friend in the Ninth Ward. His mix of charisma and bravado established him as grass-roots activist darling to the American Left. Everything changed in 2008 when two youths were arrested for attempting to disrupt the Republican National Convention. Darby, working as an informant for the FBI, infiltrated the protest group, and was largely responsible for their arrest. Darby is a confusing, complex riddle of a character vilified by his former friends and praised by groups like the Tea Party. Filmmaker Jamie Meltzer reveals the bigger truths behind Darbys actions through engaging interviews with all the major players and stylized reenactments (featuring Darby playing himself) in this spellbinding and provocative work. INFORMANT allows Darby to come clean about his actions."
