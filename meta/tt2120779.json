  "overview": "When doctors diagnosed 19-year-old rock star Jason Becker with Lou Gehrig's Disease, they said he would never make music again and that he wouldn\u2019t live to see his 25th birthday. 22 years later, without the ability to move or to speak, Jason is alive and making music with his eyes.",
  "storyline": "A documentary film about the extraordinary life of a famous, musical prodigy who has been battling against Lou Gehrig's Disease for 22 years. A paralyzing, terminal illness with no real treatment or cure, it has trapped Jason inside of his body for over 15 years; unable to move, unable to speak, and unable to play the instrument which propelled him to international stardom at just 19 years of age. Using an eye communication system invented by his father, Jason is able to escape the confines of his own body and release the music that is trapped inside of his mind.",
