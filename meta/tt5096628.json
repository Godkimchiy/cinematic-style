  "overview": "Th\u00e9o and Hugo meet in a sex club, recognize each other, become entangled in a passionate embrace. Once the desire and elation of this first moment has passed, the two young men, now sober, wander through the empty streets of nocturnal Paris, having to confront the love they sense blossoming between them.",
  "storyline": "Theo and Hugo are two young gay men who meet one night during a gay orgy at an underground sex club in Paris, France. After building a special connection, they meet outside the club where they realize they had unprotected sex. During the next 90 minutes, we follow them as they leave the club and get to know each other during bicycling and walking in northeast Paris, visiting a hospital after one of them learns he is HIV positive where they get tested and discuss treatment. They ride the Paris Metro subway, encountering an elderly woman on the subway and then interact with counter server in a kebab shop, before stopping at one of theirs apartment. The action of the film is set entirely in real time as it begins at 4:27 am and concludes at 5:59 am.",
