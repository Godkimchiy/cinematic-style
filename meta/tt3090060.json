He has given up a career as a musician following the arrival of their daughter. Lauren is very nearly 18 and is a champion swimmer. In his spare time, he substitutes for a cello player in an orchestra and is applying for a permanent role. Keith finds his life frustrating, resents his job as a teacher, and his wife's dismissal of his music playing. He wants to move back to the city and work as a musician but his wife Megan refuses to consider this as she disliked the uncertainty of the income and the lifestyle.\n\nThe family is to host a foreign exchange student, Sophie, for one semester. When Sophie arrives she is disappointed by the distance from Manhattan which she wanted to visit. Sophie's mother died when she was very young and she was raised by her Uncle and Aunt. Her Uncle introduced her to the piano but has recently died, affecting Sophie badly. Sophie tells her aunt that she is not practising her music because she doesn't know who she is playing for any more.\n\nSophie reveals to Keith that she is an accomplished musician and they bond over their mutual interest. While they are alone at the house, she tells Keith about the death of her Uncle and that she wants to choose to play music. Sophie is unsure and has lost her purpose following her Uncle's death, so she doesn't play. Keith has chosen not to play for the sake of his family.\n\nKeith and Sophie embark on a love affair, spending time together talking about running away together. Lauren discovers this and reveals her knowledge to Sophie who panics and tells Keith she must leave. Keith tells her he will run away with her. They plan to meet in New York City after a performance, packing their things.\n\nLauren, angry at her Father and having been spurned by Aaron, gets drunk and crashes her car. At the same time, Megan discovers Keith and Sophie's affair and their plan to run away. While she is smashing things around the house in anger, she gets a call telling her Lauren is hurt and in hospital.\n\nFollowing his performance, Keith meets up with Sophie.

He appears at the hospital where Megan tells him she doesn't know how Lauren is.\n\nThe film ends with the family having a photo shoot. Lauren is fine but has a scar near her eye.
