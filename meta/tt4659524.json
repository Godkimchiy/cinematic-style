  "storyline": "In 1999 Lucia Murat wrote, produced and directed the feature film \"Brave New Land\" where the Kadiw\u00e9u people - native Brazilian Indians who live in the West of Brazil - were characters. \"The Nation That Didn't Wait For God\" is a documentary shot in 2013/2014 about this same tribe, by the same director, co-directed by Rodrigo Hinrichsen, the assistant director of \"Brave New Land\". Throughout these 15 years, electricity has arrived to the reservation and with it so did television, soap operas, etc. Five protestant churches were settled in their village, and all of them have Kadiw\u00e9u pastors. But in keeping with their warrior tradition, they have gone back to fighting for their land that the white cattle breeder men have invaded. This documentary shows us the different paths that the Kadiw\u00e9u tribe has taken.",
