  "storyline": "A Roma boy is placed in a mental hospital and experiences the Nazi euthanasia program. Aware of what was happening and attached to friends, the lad attempts to sabotage the program. The film addresses the complexities of the program director, the lives of the child victims, and the struggles of the child protagonist. More than five thousand children were killed in the Nazi euthanasia program.",
  "plot": "Conor, a lighthouse keeper, lives on an island with son Ben, his pregnant wife Bronagh, and sheepdog C\u00fa. Bronagh disappears late one night, presumably dying after childbirth, leaving behind daughter Saoirse.\n\nSix years later, Conor is broken, Saoirse is mute, and Ben is antagonistic towards Saoirse, blaming her for Bronagh's disappearance. On her birthday, she is visited by Granny, the grandmother. That night, Ben scares Saoirse with a story of Mac Lir and his mother Macha, the Owl Witch, who stole his feelings and turned him to stone. Later, Saoirse plays a seashell horn given to Ben by their mother, leading her to a white sealskin coat in Conor's closet. She wears the coat and walks to a group of seals in the sea, revealing her as a selkie. After swimming, she is found by Granny, who insists upon taking the children to the city. Conor reluctantly agrees despite Ben's protests, and locks the coat in a chest, throwing it into the sea.\n\nOn Halloween, Saoirse plays the shell, alerting F\u00e6rie to her. Ben and her attempt to go home, but encounter the F\u00e6rie, hopeful that Saoirse will allow them to go to T\u00edr na n\u00d3g. However, they are attacked by Macha's owls, turning the F\u00e6rie to stone. They take a country bus, where they run into C\u00fa, who had followed them. However, Saoirse is growing ill. They come across a sacred well that Saoirse falls into. Ben follows and meets the Great Seanacha\u00ed: They learn that she was kidnapped by Macha, and that she is mute because she needs the coat otherwise she will die. He gives Ben one of his hairs that will lead him to Macha, showing that Bronagh - a selkie herself - returned to the ocean, remorsefully watching.\n\nBen then meets Macha, who claims that when Mac Lir suffered from a broken heart, she turned him into an island near their home. Ben manages to rescue Saoirse, giving Macha her feelings, recognizing that taking away feelings doesn't help. She helps them fly them back home, and Conor attempts to take Saoirse to a hospital; simultaneously, Granny is near the island to find them. Ben dives into the sea in search of Saoirse's coat, and recovers it with the seals and Conor. The group is then washed up on Mac Lir's island, where Saoirse is fully healthy and sings the song of the sea. F\u00e6rie rise and travel to Mac Lir and he emerges with Macha and his dogs as they head to T\u00edr na n\u00d3g.\n\nBronagh appears preparing to depart with Saoirse, but Ben pleads to let her stay with them. Since she is half-human, the choice rests with Saoirse, who elects to remain behind with her father and brother. Bronagh takes her coat and departs. After a tearful goodbye, the Faeries depart across the sea, and Ben and his family happily return home to their island, where Granny finally arrives, and decides the children can stay with their father. Ben and Saoirse reconcile and become friends.",
