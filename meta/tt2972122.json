  "overview": "Insects mate, stories are born. The concept of \u201clove\u201d gets put under  the looking glass in this captivatingly maverick film. Manuel, a lonely  36-year-old, begins an unusual friendship with the much younger Alma.  A young foreign couple set out on an idyllic backpacking trip in Costa  Rica. A Mexico City taxi driver visits a dive bar where he meets a sexy  lounge singer. Vicente runs into an old classmate from high school and  has something profound to share with her. Meanwhile, throughout the  film, different couples speak about their relationships and thoughts",
  "storyline": "A cinematic essay that takes us through different couples who allow us to penetrate their intimacy. Irene and Federico meet by chance after ten years of not seeing each other. Manuel is thirty-six; he begins a relationship with Alma, a girl of fifteen. Porfirio has hidden sexual desires. Jacca and Sae get lost in a mangrove swamp. Reflecting on relationships, sex, fidelity, love and death, it juxtaposes insect sexual behavior with human sexual behavior, our most primitive desire. Love is deeply animal, and therein lays its beauty.",
