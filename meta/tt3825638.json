  "overview": "A young prosecutor in postwar West Germany investigates a massive conspiracy to cover up the Nazi pasts of prominent public figures.",
  "storyline": "The year is 1958. The war has been over for thirteen years and the Federal Republic of Germany is not only recovering but even booming. But where are the Nazis? Who has ever heard of the death camps? It looks as if everything is for the best in the best of all possible worlds in this land of milk and honey - At least, until the day journalist Thomas Gnielka reports on the recognition by a German-Jewish artist of a local schoolteacher, a former guard at the Auschwitz concentration camp - At least, until Johann Radmann, a young prosecutor, decides to investigate the case - Nobody knows it yet but this is the dawn of a new era. Even if the road to awareness will be long and rocky.",
  "plot": "It's 1958, Johann Radmann is a young and idealistic public prosecutor who takes an interest in the case of Charles Schulz, a former Auschwitz extermination camp commander, who is now teaching at a school in Frankfurt am Main. Radmann is determined to bring Schulz to justice, but he finds his efforts frustrated because many former Nazis serve in the government, and they look out for each other.\n\nHis boss, the prosecutor-general Fritz Bauer, puts him in charge of investigating former workers at the Auschwitz camp. The U.S. occupation forces give him access to their files and he discovers there were 8,000 of them. He goes after Josef Mengele, who is living in Argentina but flies back to West Germany at will to visit his family. After officialdom block his attempt to issue an arrest warrant, his boss warns him off and tells him to stick to the small fry. The department then invites Mossad agents to visit, and shares its information with them. As a result, Adolf Eichmann is kidnapped and tried in Israel. Having pulled off this coup, Israel declines to pursue Mengele.\n\nMeanwhile, Radmann allows himself to be seduced by Marlene, a seamstress who, benefiting from his connections, is able to start a business as a dress designer. He is brought to a crisis when he discovers that his own father was in the Nazi party. After he tells her that her father too was in the Nazi party she breaks it off with him, but by the end of the film there is a chance she will have him back. He resigns his official post and goes to work for an industrialist, but when he finds this means working with a colleague who had defended a former Nazi he was investigating, he walks out. After going to Auschwitz to say kaddish, the Jewish mourning prayer, for a friend's two daughters who were killed there, he goes back to work for the West German state prosecutor. The film ends with the opening of the trial of several hundred former Auschwitz workers.",
