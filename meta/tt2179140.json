  "overview": "Cinema Jenin follows an ambitious initiative to re-open a previously abandoned cinema in the West Bank city of Jenin. Founded in the 1960s, it was once the largest cinema in Palestine, today it stands as a hollow echo of its society. Re-building the cinema, Germans and Palestinians come together evoking often comedic but always political and cultural ramifacations. Cinema Jenin witnessed an intimate, nuanced and textured view into the city and its domestic affairs as well as the journey of a dedicated, loyal, often conflicted group of people who hope that the re-building of the cinema will be a bridge to peace, freedom and Palestinian self-empowerment.",
  "storyline": "A Fellini-Esq documentary that takes place in the West Bank city of Jenin and follows a local initiative to re-open the old and only cinema in the city. Cinema Jenin, founded in the 1960s, was once the largest cinema in the Palestinian territories. Today it stands as a hollow echo of its society. It is crumbling and seems just about to collapse; taking all the old stories it once contained crashing down with it. And yet, there are still hints of its glamor days for anyone to see. An extraordinary group of Palestinians hope to restore glory to the city and perhaps to themselves, embarking on an almost impossible mission to re-open the cinema.",
