  "storyline": "O Exerc\u00edcio do Caos (The exercise of chaos) narrates in tones of an existentialist thriller the story of an authoritarian and grim father living with his three teenage daughters in an old farm of cassava in the countryside of the Brazilian state of Maranh\u00e3o, very, very far from the town. The family shares the absence of the mother - allegedly disappeared - and deals with the dictates of a strange and strict taskmaster which explores the family while keeps himself stalking the innocence of the girls, which in turn are divided between the illusion of childhood and the cruel reality of their lives. While the foundation of the family crumbles more and more, the weakened characters, stand on the threshold between reason and madness, between chaos and faith.",
