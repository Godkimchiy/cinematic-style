  "overview": "The story about three radical environmentalists coming together to execute the most intense protest of their lives: the explosion of a hydroelectric dam.",
  "storyline": "Josh and Dena, two young environmental activists, are planning a large scale act to force the world to think about what they're doing to the environment. They pull in Harmon, a man with a sketchy past, to help them pull off their big plan. However, unforeseen consequences bring a whole host of guilt, paranoia and other problems, and their ultimate act will change themselves more than the world around them.",
  "plot": "Radical environmentalists Josh and Dena buy a boat and tow it long-distance to meet Harmon, an ex-Marine. The three plan to bomb a dam which they believe is harming the environment. They buy fertilizer, assemble a bomb and load it onto the boat. At night, they take the boat to the dam, arm the bomb, and escape. After the explosion, Harmon says goodbye and drives away. Josh and Dena are stopped by the police, but evade suspicion.\n\nJosh returns to the farm where he lives and works. The other people living on the farm discuss the explosion; the media reports that a man who was camping near the dam is missing. Harmon calls Josh and tells him that Dena is worried. Concerned that she will go to the police, Josh agrees to talk to her. Dena admits her feelings of guilt and when pressed by Josh, she does not rule out talking to the police or the camper's family. They argue and she leaves. Harmon tells Josh that Dena needs to be silenced.\n\nThe other people living on the farm suspect Josh of involvement with the bombing and ask him to leave. He learns that the man was found dead after drowning from the flooding caused by the explosion. He then surprises Dena at the spa where she works; he tries to warn her, but she attacks him and runs. He finds her in a sauna and strangles her to death.\n\nJosh calls Harmon in tears to tell him that Dena is dead. Harmon says they cannot communicate again and tells Josh to disappear. Josh destroys his phone and asks for a job in a camping supplies store.",
