  "overview": "A girl falls for the \"perfect\" guy, who happens to have a very fatal flaw: he's a hitman on the run from the crime cartels who employ him.",
  "storyline": "After going through a painful break-up, a woman meets a man who appears to be perfect for her. However, as their relationship develops, she learns that he is a former hit-man. Their new, but genuine, relationship is tested even further as they try to save each other, from his dark past which has come back to haunt him.",
  "plot": "Martha is an eccentric woman who leaves her boyfriend after she discovers that he is cheating on her. Elsewhere, Francis is seen knocking on a hotel door. A woman answers and Francis explains that he is the hit-man that she hired to kill her law partner so that she would own the firm outright; he then puts on a red clown nose, tells her that murder is wrong, and shoots her dead. At the same time, a team of assassins are preparing to trap Francis in the hotel. Hopper, a hit man who once worked with Francis, chooses to remain behind in the surveillance van, as he knows that Francis will overpower the unprofessional assassins. Hopper listens as the assassins are killed, while the audience watches Francis demonstrate his skills. After the incident, Hopper receives a phone call from his bosses, who instruct him to pretend to be an FBI agent and to partner with a local New Orleans police detective, Gus Patrick, who has been assigned to capture Francis.\n\nThe following day, Martha spends the morning at a pet store where her roommate works. On the way home from the store, Martha stops at a convenience market. Francis, also in the market, is attracted to her quirkiness. He asks her out on a date and the pair spend the next ten hours together. Francis is honest with Martha about his line of work, but she assumes that he is being sarcastic. As the pair stroll through the park, Francis senses that a hit-man is near, and he dances with Martha while evading a bullet streaming past them. They end up spending the night together.\n\nThe next morning, Francis leaves Martha a note, asking her to continue their date that night. Martha is smitten and makes breakfast for her roommate Sophie, who is skeptical of Francis. The new couple meet in a bar that night. There, Francis recognizes Espinoza, one of the hit-men who survived the hotel. Francis excuses himself and follows Espinoza outside, where Francis kills him.\n\nAt the same time, brothers from a mob family are hiding out in New Orleans. The younger brother, Von Cartigan, has ambition, but lacks brains and skill; he convinces a local thug named Johnny Moon to join him in hiring Francis, who now has a reputation for killing the people who hire him. Thus, his plan is to hire the hit-man for his older brother Richard, whom Francis would kill, so that Von can take over the mob.\n\nFrancis takes Martha with him to the initial meeting for the hit-man job. From the car, she watches as Francis puts on a clown nose and kills the man who tried to hire him. Martha, now realizing that Francis has been truthful about his line of work, panics and asks him to take her home. Unbeknownst to Francis, Johnny follows the pair to her apartment and gives her address to the mob brothers.\n\nLater that day, Hopper and Gus interview Martha and explain that Francis is a hit-man with a conscience. At this time, Martha realizes that she is falling for a dangerous criminal. Francis decides to come to the apartment. Although Hopper is waiting for him, Francis is able to stun him unconscious. Francis drags Hopper into the apartment, where he tells Martha and Sophie that Hopper is not an FBI agent. Martha does not know what to believe, but then remembers that Francis has always told her the truth. She decides to go with him. As they leave, assassins working for the mob family arrive. One assassin, Steve, surprises Francis with his impressive combat skills, and the pair express mutual admiration. As Francis takes care of the other assassins, he is again surprised when Steve disarms him. The mobsters take Martha and provide an address where Francis can find them. As they make their escape, Francis fights Hopper. When Gus arrives, Hopper shoots him dead. Francis escapes unseen.\n\nFrancis arrives at the mobsters' house to rescue Martha, at which point Von tells Francis to kill Richard, revealing his treachery to his brother. Francis refuses and leaves the room to look for Martha, and Von kills Richard himself. After Francis finds Martha, the pair run into Hopper, who fights Francis while Johnny captures Martha. Realizing that she possesses similar skills to Francis, Martha is able to kill first Johnny and then Von. Outside, Hopper is preparing to shoot Francis when he is killed by Steve. Grateful, Francis tells Steve that Hopper is worth five-million dollars, dead or alive. As Steve celebrates, Francis and Martha leave hand-in-hand.\n\nTwo months later, Martha and Francis are living in Vietnam. A hit-man watches as the pair decide where to travel to next. Before he can pull the trigger, Martha sneaks up and shoots him dead.",
  "synopsis": "Martha (Anna Kendrick) is home at her apartment when her boyfriend bursts in making out with another woman. While they try to rope Martha into a threesome, she decides to leave as her boyfriend says she has no sense of adventure. Martha replies by throwing something at his head.We meet the hitman, \"Mr. Right\", whose real name is Francis (Sam Rockwell). He was assigned to kill a man by the man's wife. Francis goes to the woman's apartment and instead kills her after having already collected his payment. Outside, a team of agents led by Hopper (Tim Roth) move into the building to get Francis. One by one, Francis picks them all off and kills the agents.Martha stays with her best friend Sophie (Katie Nehra) until she gets back on her feet. The two go out drinking, but Martha is looking out to see if her boyfriend could be there. She continues to blame herself for him cheating on her while Sophie tries to persuade her otherwise.Sophie takes Martha to get a pet. Martha picks out a cat that Sophie warns her is ferocious, but Martha doesn't listen and the cat ends up scratching Sophie. Afterward, Martha goes to a supermarket and runs into Francis when she accidentally knocks over a bunch of condoms, all of which Francis catches quickly. Despite coming off a little creepy at first, Martha lets Francis tag along with her, and the two end up spending the day together. However, several hitmen looking for Francis have eyes on him, but Francis is always one step ahead and avoids getting shot.Two hitmen brothers, Von and Richie Cartigan (James Ransone and Anson Mount), want to employ Francis to kill a specific target of theirs. Both brothers are at odds with each other constantly, and Von really wants Richie out of the picture. Meanwhile, Hopper (who is really assuming another man's identity) still wants Francis dead.Martha and Francis go out on an actual date at a restaurant. Francis is pulled out repeatedly when one hitman is outside demanding that Francis contribute his services to the hitman's employers, but Francis refuses and fights the man before ultimately stabbing him in the neck. Francis rejoins Martha and casually says he had to kill someone, which she thinks is just a joke.At home, Martha comments that she doesn't even know Francis's name after a few days of seeing each other. Francis says he hates his name. Martha then asks him how he caught all the condom boxes the other day. Francis demonstrates his skills with knives as he tries to get Martha to catch them. Although she's freaked out at first, she feels a rush of excitement from catching the knives.Martha joins Francis one afternoon by a bridge. As Martha waits in the car, she sees Francis meeting with a man on the bridge. The man attempts to get Francis to work for him and his employers, but Francis shoots the man in front of Martha. She gets freaked out and realizes Francis wasn't joking about killing anyone.After Francis drops Martha off at home, she sits in disbelief until Hopper (saying he's from the FBI) arrives at Sophie's to tell the ladies all about Francis and his work, mainly that he kills off the people that employ him because he abides by a moral code of his, which is that killing is wrong (unless some people deserve it), and also that he wears a clown nose during his kills. Hopper warns Martha that Francis is a very dangerous individual.Hopper comes across Francis's location, but the hitman gets to him first and knocks him out, then drags him into Sophie's apartment. Martha then forgives Francis for the whole hitman thing, and they start making out. However, one of Hopper's guys tells him through his radio that they're coming for Francis. He gets Martha out of there, just as some bad guys, led by another hitman employed by the Cartigans, Shotgun Steve (RZA), start attacking. Francis takes most of them out, but Martha ends up getting kidnapped.Martha is taken to the Cartigans home, and Francis follows. Von taunts Martha and smacks her a couple times, but she's not scared of him. Francis decides to team up with Steve, and they storm the house. After taking out several hitmen, Francis decides he's done with killing, and he leaves a gun between Von and Richie for them to settle it. The brothers jump for their gun. Von grabs it and kills Richie. Meanwhile, Martha is set free and kills one of the Cartigans' hitmen before coming across Von. She gets his gun and shoots him to death.Outside, Hopper confronts Francis, but he gets killed by Steve. Francis tells Steve that Hopper was worth a hefty bounty, making Steve a rich man.In the end, Francis and Martha continue their relationship, but they are still being pursued by bad guys that want Francis dead. While on a date, Francis writes a message to one of the bad guys surveying them from afar. He writes \"Where's the girl?\" as Martha is not sitting with him. She appears next to the bad guy with a gun aimed at his head, and she pulls the trigger."
