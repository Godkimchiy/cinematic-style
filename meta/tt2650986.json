As things escalate between Bj\u00f6rn and Jamal, Casper finds himself and his family dead center of a conflict, that threatens to destroy them.",
  "storyline": "18-year-old Caspar wants to reach the top, no matter what. He carries out small-time break-ins for Jamal, before moving on to work for big player Bj\u00f6rn. All goes well, until Jamal's gang decide they want revenge. What starts with pushing and shoving soon escalates into armed conflict. This is a big test for Caspar: is he ruthless enough for this battle? And will he drag his younger brother into it?",

  "synopsis": "Northwest is one of the most impoverished multi-ethnic areas of Copenhagen. 18-years-old Casper lives in Northwest with his mother, younger brother and his little sister. Casper struggles to make ends meet based on selling stolen goods to one of the neighborhood pack leaders. When organized crime hits Northwest the hierarchy of the neighborhood shifts and Casper is offered a chance to climb the ranks. Soon he is hurled into a world of drugs, violence and prostitution and as things escalates, his childhood playground becomes a battlefield. Consequently Casper finds himself and his family dead center in a conflict that threatens to destroy them.Northwest is a film about youth crime, the price of greed and a rootless, young man's longing for a sense of belonging and to show the world hes a real man.\nThe film is about Casper who, for his own gain, drags his younger brother Bastian into organized crime to get the young king and childhood friend Jamal down with his neck. But power is not something you get, it's a position you have to take and Casper realizes he does not have the ability to go from being a thief to a murderer and thereby he inadvertently presses his brother to commit murder.\nCasper is driven by money and power but Bastian is driven by much stronger forces; the desire for a sense of belonging and longing for a father figure.\nNorthwest is a film about brothers, brother cabinet and how childhood friends end up fighting each other for power and glory."
