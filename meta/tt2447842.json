  "overview": "For John Cuttin it all started with the first sip of the wine of her life. A \"Marzemino\", a typical wine of the province of Trento, quoted by Lorenzo Da Ponte in his libretto for \"Don Giovanni\" by Mozart.  The instant he tasted the blood-red drop of nectar John felt a sort of pleasant and mysterious explosion of the senses, and from that moment on, his nature is transformed. In just three years, from shy bank clerk and faithful husband became director, tombeur de femmes and the most revered and respected expert on wine in Italy. Just as he had predicted the enigmatic \"Professor\" who had convinced him to taste his first glass of wine. The only event that the \"Professor\" with his accent and his piercing blue eyes, had not predicted was that he would soon be charged with the murder of his wife Adele. While being put under pressure by the Commissioner Sanfelice, John is to reflect on the last three years of his life, dominated by a single and mad passion: wine.",
  "storyline": "It all started with the first wine sip Giovanni Cuttin had in his life. A Marzemino, a wine mentioned by Lorenzo da Ponte in his libretto for Mozart's Don Giovanni. Since then, the shy clerk becomes the bank director, a lady-killer and the most revered wine expert in Italy. But soon he will be charged for his wife's murder. Being grilled by Inspector Sanfelice, Giovanni reflects on the last 3 years of his life, dominated by an only mad passion: wine. Gradually the investigation becomes more and more caught between the boundaries of reality and its dreamlike counterpart. What if Giovanni, like Faust, met a diabolic force that made his life very special, only to settle the score later?",
