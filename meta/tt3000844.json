  "overview": "\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered\" introduces a dedicated quartet of civil servants in the Dead Letter Office of the U.S. Postal System who transform themselves into an elite team of lost-mail detectives. Their determination to deliver the seemingly undeliverable takes them out of the post office into an unpredictable world where letters and packages from the past save lives, solve crimes, reunite old loves, and change futures by arriving late, but always miraculously on time.",
  "storyline": "In this prequel to the series, old-fashioned gentleman Oliver O'Toole's well-oiled team for lost letters is accidentally joined by ambitious Internet age postal Shane McInerney. They bond over the tragic case of a couple in the making. A year ago, charming law firm office boy Charlie quit his demeaning dogsbody job after falling in love at first sight with Kelly. She accepted to spend a perfect day with him, yet refused to meet again. As the team traces the couple's year since, tragedy is found for both, yet they hope to help them get together, or at least prevent suffering a tragic injustice.",
