But witnessing his sister Vivienne about to marry his childhood crush Jack a light bulb flicks on, passions ignite and the wedding must immediately be stopped!Jack is a line cook at Johns flagship restaurant, ready to build a future and a family. He has quietly given up hope that John would ever fall for him and support his dreams of running a super restaurant together one day. As years of mounting tensions culminate into an over-heated argument in the kitchen, Jack throws an apple at Johns head -- bruising his bosss ego and unfurling a series of ill-timed events that teach them both good reason to grow up.John tries to out Jack to save his sister from eventual heartache by outing himself to his family. This revelation is secretly old news for everyone, no one had cared but yet Johns parents use the opportunity to push their aimless son to make something of his life by cutting him off financially.The spoilt promiscuous John was once easy for Jack to ignore. But a newer, penniless, more soulful man may soon prove too hard to kick to the curb. Before the fresh, bountiful ingredients rot away in a glamorous but empty kitchen the challenge for both John and Jack is to find a way to blend money, sex, love and family into one sumptuous recipe for life."
