  "storyline": "Moments after parachuting from Flight 777, former Marine Chad Turner (Craig Scheffer) and flight attendant Dao (Sonia Couling) find themselves descending into a world of madness. The Tribulation has begun. Panic and chaos plague the streets, and cities are on fire. But they have even greater problems. They're being hunted by a team of mercenaries lead by Joseph Pike (Gary Daniels) and funded by the power-hungry, Phillip Turk (Ivan Kamaras) with orders to extract the biometric microchip living in Chad Turner's body and prepare it for the masses. The only hope to protect the microchip and prevent it from falling into the hands of evil is for Chad to summon all his elite skills in battle to outrun and outlast the forces against him -- and call on a higher power to provide the necessary strength to prevail.",
  "plot": "Chad Turner (Craig Sheffer) is implanted with a biometric computer chip (the Mark of the Beast). The Rapture occurs, and Joseph Pike (Gary Daniels) searches for Turner in hopes of gaining control of the Mark of the Beast. Cooper (Eric Roberts), the head of security of Avanti, the company that created the chip, is held hostage by Pike in order to locate Turner. Chad Turner must stay alive against all odds and keep the chip from falling into the wrong hands. As the story moves forward, Chad becomes more still within his faith and understands the nature of the situation. Just then the rapture happens and Chad decides to escape with his friend, off the plane. They make it out but discover that the tribulation has begun.",
