  "storyline": "In a small coastal town, the veterinarian Travis Shaw works with his father Shep and is very close to his beloved sister Steph. Travis is very successful with the women and dates Monica every now and then. When the resident Gabby Holland moves to the next door house, she initially believes he is a pretentious man. But when her boyfriend Ryan MacCarthy, who is fellow doctor in the same hospital where she works, needs to travel to another city, Gabby and Travis have a relationship and fall in love with each other. Out of the blue, Ryan returns and proposes to marry her. Now Gabby has to make a choice between her two loves.",
  "plot": "Travis Shaw is a playboy, living in small coastal town Wilmington, NC. He has an on-off relationship with Monica. His next door neighbor, Gabby Holland, is a medical student who is in a relationship with a fellow doctor, Ryan McCarthy. One night, after Travis holds a barbecue with his closest friends and sister, Steph, at his home, Gabby angrily goes over to Travis' home to complain about the loud music, and how his dog, Moby, might have impregnated her dog, Molly, to which Travis denies but proposes she visit the veterinary clinic with Molly.\n\nGabby visits the veterinary clinic the next day, only to find out that Travis works there as a veterinarian, and that his father owns and runs the clinic as well. Travis and Gabby start to bond through home dinners and boat trips with Travis' friends and Steph, who also continually teases him about Gabby. Travis also helps Molly when she gives birth to 3 puppies in Gabby's home. With Ryan out of state overseeing a new hospital opening, Gabby and Travis end up spending more time together, starting a relationship.\n\nAs Ryan returns ahead of schedule and arranges a dinner between his parents and Gabby, Travis sees them having dinner and walks over to their table to say hi, and as he leaves, Gabby runs after Travis and they argue about what their relationship really meant during Ryan's absence. Travis declares his love for Gabby multiple times, however Gabby replies by saying she does not know what she want. Unsure of her feelings, Gabby tells Travis that their relationship wasn't necessarily serious and ends up accepting Ryan's marriage proposal, while Travis gets back together with Monica.\n\nAfter some time, Monica breaks up with Travis telling him that she knows about him and Gabby, and that he should fight for her because they love each other. Travis rushes to the hospital, only to find out from Ryan that Gabby has left, breaking off her engagement with Ryan, following which Ryan punches Travis out of anger. Travis then drives over to Gabby's family home to find her, and after mistakenly confessing his love to an elderly couple he had thought to be Gabby's parents (while Gabby's parents are standing right behind Travis), Gabby's parents encourage Travis to propose to Gabby, to Gabby's surprise. Gabby's mother gives Travis Gabby's grandmother's ring, to which he uses to propose to Gabby, who finally says yes.\n\nThey marry and over the course of the next few years, Travis and Gabby have a son and a daughter and become a happy family.\n\nOne evening during a storm, after a dinner to which Travis has failed to show up again due to a work emergency at the clinic, Gabby drives back home extremely sad to be stood up again and is involved in a terrible car accident. She survives but is now in a coma. Travis is wrecked with guilt and has to make the choice, whether or not to take her off life support as was stated in her wishes. Steph, now married and pregnant as well, finds Travis talking to his mother's grave and tells him to follow his heart no matter what other people say.\n\nOne night, a bad storm nearly destroys their home, and the next morning, Travis goes through the wreckage of the storm, looking for the wind chime which Gabby hung on her home porch. The next morning, he sees Moby stuck on a wooden platform in the lake, and when he goes to get Moby, Moby indicates he has found the wind chime stuck on the wooden platform. Travis then collects wooden parts from the wreckage, and goes to his island to build a small gazebo at the spot where he and Gabby once sat, looking at the moon and stars. Travis hangs the wind chime on the gazebo. As he sits there, the wind chime suddenly starts to ring loudly against the wind, and Travis rushes back to the hospital, fearing the worst. As he arrives in Gabby's hospital room, he enters to see that Gabby has awakened from her coma, and tell him 'You're late.'\n\nTravis takes Gabby home where she is welcomed by their two children, and Steph's newborn child. To make up for missing their dinner date, Travis prepares a romantic dinner in the front yard where as the children are cooking dinner, Gabby tells Travis that she heard everything he said when she was in the coma, and that he saved her. The last shot is of Travis and Gabby, with their two children sitting on the porch on the island, looking up at the moon and stars.",
