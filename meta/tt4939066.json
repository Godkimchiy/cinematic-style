  "overview": "A squad of soldiers fight in the Korean War's crucial Battle of Incheon.",
  "storyline": "American General Douglas MacArthur (Liam Neeson) sends eight members of the Korean Liaison Office, led by a South Korean Navy Lieutenant (Lee Jung-Jae) on a secret mission far behind North Korean lines to carry out Operation \"X-ray\". This covert operation must succeed so that MacArthur can launch the daring Incheon Landing Operation.This is a fictionalized version of the historical CIA/military intelligence operation \"Trudy Jackson\", part of Operation Chromite.",
  "plot": "The year is 1950, just a few months after North Korean forces have overrun most of South Korea. After a UN coalition led by the U.S. comes to the nation\u2019s aid, General Douglas MacArthur devises a secret plan to attack behind enemy lines at the port city of Incheon. The risky strategem is opposed by leaders of the other military branches, forcing MacArthur to devise a clandestine operation to gather essential information from within occupied Incheon by coordinating a weeklong South Korean spy operation known as X-Ray.\n\nThe linchpin of this top-secret incursion is the captain of South Korean Navy Special Forces, Jang Hak-soo and 7 members of the KLO (Korean Liaison Office) unit disguise themselves as a North Korean inspection unit and infiltrate the North Korean army command center in Incheon, coordinated by Commander Lim Gye-jin, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of supreme leader Kim Il-sung. Their prime objective is to determine the placement of North Korean defenses and the tactical characteristics of Incheon harbor, notorious for swift currents and major tidal surges and secure a lighthouse crucial to the landing's success.\n\nImmediately suspicious of Jang\u2019s \"inspection mission\", Lim attempts to impede his comrade\u2019s investigation and orders his staff to monitor the new arrivals closely. The U.S. command relays MacArthur\u2019s orders to obtain navigation charts showing naval mine placements in the harbor and prepare a strategy to assist the coalition forces with landing an amphibious assault in a narrow two-hour window between tides. When contacts within the local underground South Korean resistance movement warn Jang that time is running out to successfully complete the mission, he pushes his group to extremes. Meanwhile in Tokyo, MacArthur prepares Operation Chromite, an invasion force of 75,000 UN troops and over 200 warships to imminently depart for the Korean Peninsula.",
