While searching for his new apartment, he unexpectedly meets Sofia, a young and attractive woman that has very little to do with his good taste. \u2018Elemental, constructed on a basis of cliches\u2019 he would describe her. Movements of random bring them together over and over again, in strangely idyllic situations. Tellez attempts to escape from a staging that he loathes, but suspects that the movie genre that he hates the most is taking its revenge.",
