  "overview": "Valentin is Acapulco's resident playboy, until a former fling leaves a baby on his doorstep and him heading with her out of Mexico.",
  "storyline": "Valentin is Acapulco's resident playboy womanizer, until a former fling, a young American named Julie, leaves a baby on his doorstep and takes off without a trace. Leaving Mexico for Los Angeles to find the baby's mother, Valentin ends up finding a new home for himself and his newfound daughter, Maggie. An unlikely father figure, Valentin raises Maggie for six years, while also establishing himself as one of Hollywood's top stuntmen to pay the bills, with Maggie acting as his on-set coach. As Valentin raises Maggie, she forces him to grow up too. But their unique and offbeat family is threatened when Maggie's birth mom, Julie, shows up out of the blue after six years after turning her own life around and wants full custody of Maggie, and Valentin realizes he's in danger of losing his daughter - and his best friend.",
  "plot": "Valent\u00edn Bravo had always been a rather fearful child, afraid of everything from heights to spiders. His father, Juan \"Johnny\" Bravo, raised him trying to make him fearless by making a tarantula walk on Valentin and throwing him off a high oceanside cliff known as La Quebrada. When his father locked Valent\u00edn in a crypt at a cemetery, Valent\u00edn began to resent his father and ran away after stating that he no longer loves him.\n\nValent\u00edn grows up to be Acapulco's local playboy and sleeps with every tourist that crosses his path. One day a former fling named Julie shows up at his doorstep with a baby girl, claiming that she is his daughter. Julie leaves the baby with Valent\u00edn after asking him for cab fare, but she doesn't come back. After receiving a phone call from Julie in which she says she is not prepared to raise a child, Valent\u00edn races to the airport to try to return the baby to Julie but fails to catch up to her before she boards her flight to Los Angeles.\n\nValent\u00edn leaves Acapulco with the baby, Maggie, and hitchhikes across Mexico toward Tijuana. After being turned back at the US border, he crosses by being smuggled in a hidden compartment in a transport truck along with numerous other Mexicans. Going only by a single photo of Julie in which a Los Angeles hotel is visible in the background, Valent\u00edn visits the hotel to track down Julie. However, when Maggie wanders to a nearby pool, Valent\u00edn ends up jumping out of a hotel presidential suite into the pool 10 stories below, rescuing his daughter. A movie director witnesses this event and hires Valent\u00edn as a stuntman \u2014 a job which Valent\u00edn accepts since he believes it is the only way he can support Maggie.\n\nAn unlikely father figure, Valent\u00edn raises Maggie for six years, giving her a happy, fun, and carefree home. Meanwhile, he also establishes himself as one of Hollywood's top stuntmen to pay the bills, with Maggie acting as his on-set coach and translator as Valent\u00edn still doesn't know any English. As Valent\u00edn raises Maggie, she forces him to grow up too in his large fears, though he does it only for her own fun. Meanwhile, during a visit to the doctor in which he receives an injection, the doctor confides in Valent\u00edn \u2014 with Maggie out of earshot \u2014 that the treatments aren't working. To hide from Maggie the fact that her mother abandoned her, Valent\u00edn writes weekly letters to Maggie from her, detailing various adventures and feats around the world to explain her absence. But Maggie wishes to meet her mother, so Valent\u00edn goes to his director, and looks for an actress to play \"Julie\". Before the casting is complete, Valent\u00edn gets a call from Julie saying that she is in Los Angeles and wants to meet.\n\nJulie tries to be a part of Maggie's life again, along with her girlfriend Renee who she lives with in New York, but after a tearful departure at the airport Julie realizes she doesn't want to just see Maggie during visits and holidays. She files for custody and cites Valent\u00edn's dangerous job and lack of English skills as reasons that he is unfit to raise Maggie. Valent\u00edn's sincerity and the story of his daring ten-story jump convince the judge that he has Maggie's best interest at heart, and he awards custody to Valentin as he is the only parent she has really known. Not backing down, Julie asks for a DNA test which proves Valent\u00edn isn't the father after all. Valent\u00edn ends up losing legal custody of Maggie, but they sneak away and decide to go back to Acapulco where he reunites with his friends, although he discovers that his father died a few years ago.\n\nJulie and Renee threaten Valent\u00edn's director to bully him into revealing Valent\u00edn's location, who repeatedly claims he doesn't know where the father and daughter are. Eventually he relents and states that Valent\u00edn has woken up every day not knowing if it would be the last day he would see his daughter, but the details are not revealed on-screen. Julie finds Valent\u00edn and Maggie on the beach and has surprisingly dropped her attempts to gain custody. Instead, the three enjoy time together as a family in Acapulco while in a voice-over Valent\u00edn narrates how doctors can sometimes discover a heart defect for which there is no cure and which could kill the patient any time. As Valent\u00edn and Julie sit on the beach with Maggie falling asleep in Valent\u00edn's lap, Maggie peacefully passes away, which reveals that she, not Valent\u00edn, was the one with the heart defect.\n\nOne year later, we see Valent\u00edn walking down the beach, with a dog but without Julie, narrating that he now understands his father's motives in wanting to prepare him for the future and give him the courage to face his fears. The film concludes with a vision of Maggie playing in heaven with her grandfather.",
  "synopsis": "As a child, Valent\u00edn Bravo (Andr\u00e9s V\u00e1zquez) was afraid of everything from heights to spiders. His father, Juan \"Johnny\" Bravo (Hugo Stiglitz), tried to make him fearless by making a tarantula walk on him and throwing him off a high ocean side cliff known as La Quebrada. When his father locked Valent\u00edn in a crypt at a cemetery, Valent\u00edn began to resent his father and ran away after stating that he no longer loves him.In the present day, Valent\u00edn (Eugenio Derbez as an adult) lives in Acapulco and is the local playboy who sleeps with every female tourist (both Mexican and foreigners) that crosses his path. One day a former fling named Julie (Jessica Lindsey), a young hippie American tourist, shows up at his doorstep with a baby girl, claiming that the baby is his daughter. Julie leaves the baby with Valent\u00edn after asking him for taxi fare, but she doesn't return. After receiving a phone call from Julie in which she says she is not prepared to raise a child, Valent\u00edn races to the airport to try to return the baby to Julie but fails to catch up to her before she boards her flight to Los Angeles.Valent\u00edn leaves Acapulco with the baby, Maggie, and hitchhikes across Mexico toward Tijuana. After being turned back at the US border when he realizes that he needs a travel visa to enter the USA (plus he has no money), he crosses by being smuggled in a hidden compartment in a transport truck driven by Lupe (Agust\u00edn Bernal) along with numerous other Mexicans. Going only by a single photo of Julie in which a Los Angeles hotel is visible in the background, Valent\u00edn visits the hotel to track down Julie. However, when Maggie wanders to a nearby pool and falls in, Valent\u00edn ends up jumping out of a hotel presidential suite into the pool 10 stories below, rescuing his daughter. A Hollywood movie director named Frank Ryan (Daniel Raymont) witnesses this event and hires Valent\u00edn as a stuntman, a job which Valent\u00edn accepts since he believes it is the only way he can support Maggie.An unlikely father figure, Valent\u00edn raises Maggie (7-year-old Loreto Peralta) for the next six years, giving her a happy, fun, carefree home in downtown Los Angeles. Meanwhile, he establishes himself as one of Hollywood's top stuntmen to pay the bills. The bilingual Maggie is his on-set coach and translator, as he still doesn't know (or hasn't bothered to learn) much English. As Valent\u00edn raises Maggie and sends her to attend public school, she forces him to grow up too in his larger fears, though he does it only for her own fun.One day, during a visit to the doctor in which he receives an injection (for untreated STD's), the doctor confides in Valent\u00edn, with Maggie out of earshot, that the \"treatments aren't working\". To hide from Maggie the fact that her mother abandoned her, Valent\u00edn writes weekly letters to Maggie from her, detailing various adventures and feats around the world to explain her absence. But Maggie wishes to meet her mother, so Valent\u00edn goes to his director, Frank, who looks for an actress to play \"Julie\". Before the casting is complete, Valent\u00edn gets a phone call from Julie saying that she is in Los Angeles and wants to get together.While out at dinner, Julie reveals that she is now a lawyer living in New York City and involved in a lesbian relationship with girlfriend Renee (Alessandra Rosaldo). After a tearful airport departure, Julie realizes that she doesn't want to just see Maggie during holidays. She files for full custody, citing Valent\u00edn's dangerous job, immaturity, and lack of English skills as reasons that he is unfit to raise Maggie. Valent\u00edn's sincerity and the story of his daring ten-story jump convince the judge that he has Maggie's best interest at heart, and he awards custody to Valentin as he is the only parent she has really known. Frank tries to persuade Valent\u00edn to tell the truth about something, but Valent\u00edn refuses.Not backing down, Julie asks for a DNA test which proves Valent\u00edn isn't Maggie's biological father. Valent\u00edn ends up losing legal custody of Maggie, but they sneak away and return to Acapulco, where he reunites with his friends... and discovers that his father has died a few years previously.Back in Los Angeles, Julie and Renee bully Frank into revealing Valent\u00edn's location. Frank repeatedly claims he doesn't know where they are, but eventually he relents and states that Valent\u00edn has woken up every day not knowing if it would be the last day he would see his daughter, but the details are not revealed on-screen.A few days later, Julie finds Valent\u00edn and Maggie on the beach and has surprisingly dropped her attempts to gain custody. Instead, the three enjoy time together as a family in Acapulco for the next two weeks while in a voice-over Valent\u00edn narrates how doctors can sometimes discover a heart defect for which there is no cure and which could kill the patient any time. As Valent\u00edn and Julie sit on the beach, Maggie falls asleep in Valent\u00edn's lap, then peacefully passes away: she, not Valent\u00edn, was the one with the heart defect.One year later, Valent\u00edn is seen walking down the beach, with a dog but without Julie, narrating that he now understands his father's motives in wanting to prepare him for the future and give him the courage to face his fears.
