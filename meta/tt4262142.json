  "overview": "A single mother becomes Ariel Castro's first kidnapping victim, and finds herself trapped in his home with two other women for 11 years.",
  "storyline": "In 2002, the single mother Michelle Knight is walking to the court for the custody case of her five year-old son Joey, of whom she had lost custody. She realizes that she is late and accepts the ride from her acquaintance Ariel Castro, who is the father of a schoolmate. He lures Michelle telling that his dog delivered several puppies and he would like to give one to her for Joey. Once inside his house, he imprisons her with chains in a dark room. For eleven years, Michelle is beaten and submitted to sexual abuse and abortion. In 2003 and 2004, Ariel also kidnaps and abuses Amanda Berry, who has a child with him, and Gina DeJesus. In 2013, Amanda succeeds in escaping from the house and the police arrive and release the women.",
  "plot": "Michelle Knight (Manning) was abducted by Ariel Castro (Cruz) on August 23, 2002 in Cleveland, Ohio. She was held captive in his home for almost 11 years before finally being rescued on May 6, 2013. Finding strength through her belief in God and determined to be reunited with her son, Knight refused to be broken down by Castro. Soon thereafter Castro kidnaps, abducts and rapes two more girls, Amanda Berry (Droke) and Gina DeJesus (Sarife). These girls too become imprisoned along with Knight. They become friends and fellow victims, and they treat each other as sisters through their years in captivity.\n\nWhen Berry became pregnant with Castro's child, it was Knight who delivered her baby, even performing CPR on the infant girl under the threat of Castro killing her if Berry's child didn't survive. Despite enduring more than a decade of brutality and captivity, Michelle's spirit would not be broken as her faith in the face of what she once thought would be a hopeless situation was a testament to the human spirit. On May 6, 2013, Michelle was rescued from the home that was her prison for nearly 11 years, and finally given the chance to reclaim her life.",
