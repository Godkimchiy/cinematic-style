  "overview": "Giggling young women who secretly feed a macho cowboy Viagra\r might sound pretty funny. But is it really?... I Stay with You starts out\r as an innocent comedy with rich girls having carefree fun. Gradually,\r however, the film undergoes a transformation, ending in dark\r sadism. Artist Artemio Narro has made a number of installations\r and videos on the subject of violence. His first fiction feature is not\r only a commentary on the ever-present violence in Mexico, but\r also on how we see violence. The changing tone of the film and an\r ingenious turnaround in the battle of the sexes makes this film a\r confrontational experience.",
  "storyline": "Natalia is a young Spanish woman who arrives in Mexico City, invited by Esteban, her boyfriend. However, due to work, he is absent, but his friends, Ana and Sofia, convince Natalia to travel to Valeria's house which is out of town, as a sort of bachelorette party. What starts out as an innocent comedy becomes an unusual and violent drama that questions the nature of power, the animality of our species, and the transposition of gender roles.",
