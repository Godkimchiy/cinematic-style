  "overview": "The film accompanies the investigation of the historian, Sidney Aguilar after the discovery of bricks marked with Nazi swastikas in the interior of S\u00e3o Paulo. They then discover a horrifying fact that during the 1930's, fifty black and mulato boys were taken from an orphanage in Rio de Janeiro to the farm where the bricks were found. There they were identified by numbers and were submitted to slave labor by a family that was part of the political and economic elite of the country and who did not hide their Nazi sympathizing ideals.  At age 83, two survivors of this Brazilian tragedy, Alo\u00edsio Silva (the \u201cboy 23\u201d) and Argemiro Santos, as well as Jos\u00e9 Alves de Almeida's (\u201cTwo's\u201d) family, tell their stories for the first time.",
  "storyline": "The film follows a historian's investigation about bricks branded with the swastika, which were found in rural S\u00e3o Paulo. The historian arrived at a frightening fact: Brazilian Nazis took fifty black boys from an orphanage in Rio de Janeiro to the ranch where the bricks were found. The boys were made slaves by a family that was part of the cream of the crop of the political and economic oligarchy in early 20th century Brazil. With the fall of Hitler, the family aborted the project and left the boys to their own devices. The film follows the life of two survivors, Alo\u00edsio Silva and Argemiro Santos, who are willing to share their stories for the first time.",
