  "overview": "The definitive documentary about the iconic television series developed by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and their production companies (AP Films and Century 21 Pictures). Supermarionation was a revolutionary technique used in all their programmes throughout the 1960s including Stingray, Captain Scarlet and, most famously, Thunderbirds.",
  "storyline": "Directed and co-produced by Stephen La Riviere and hosted by Lady Penelope and Parker themselves, 'Filmed in Supermarionation' is a screen adaptation of his book of the same name and features a wealth of previously unseen archive footage, brand new interviews with the surviving casts and crews and clips from the shows themselves. A highlight of the film are ingenious and accurate recreations of the pioneering techniques used in the productions.",
