Slater seems to have the perfect life, the perfect job and the perfect girlfriend. But when Slater's girlfriend is abducted by Brand New-U, and a corpse left in her place, he is forced to become an Identical. As he moves through a series of parallel lives, he becomes more and more obsessed with finding his girlfriend, but what he must find in the end is himself.",
