  "storyline": "Zimbelism is a reflective voyage through the back half of the 20th century framed with presidents, farmers, railroad engineers, movie stars, children, architecture and a unique way of seeing the human experience. George Zimbel's work has documented the 20th century with grace, spontaneity and a remarkable eye for telling a story in one 35 mm frame. \"You can take a photograph at 1/100 of a second\", Zimbel says, \"but it takes longer to read it. Reading a photograph is like taking a trip, you see things that kindle all kinds of memories, good and bad. Your life is the reference\".",
