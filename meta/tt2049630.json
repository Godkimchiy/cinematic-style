  "overview": "A Muslim fundamentalist in New York kidnaps a liberal Muslim scholar with intent to kill. A closeted lesbian in New Delhi kidnaps her activist bisexual lover with intent to marry. The resulting torture and violence evokes a brutal struggle of identities against unfreedom.",
  "storyline": "UNFREEDOM is an urgent contemporary thriller about a society torn apart by political, religious, and sexual turmoil. Shifting between New York and New Delhi, the film juxtaposes two powerful and unflinching stories about religious fundamentalism and intolerance, one of which follows a Muslim terrorist attempting to silence a liberal Muslim scholar, while the other is about a young woman who defies her devout father and escapes an arranged marriage because she is secretly embroiled in a taboo lesbian romance. In this searing portrait of the polarized world we live in, all four characters go to their absolute limit-and beyond-in their struggle to defend their deeply-held and conflicting viewpoints on freedom, faith, family and love.",
  "plot": "Set in two different cities, New York and New Delhi, the film approaches sexuality and violence head on with a focus on the Muslim and LGBT identities.\n\nIn New York arrives a fundamentalist Muslim Mohammed Husain, imprisoned by his brutal past, on a mission to kidnap and kill a peaceful Muslim scholar, Fareed Rahmani. \u201cThe choices we make, when we are most cornered in life, define who we are.\u201d Once they come face to face, the only way out is through a true examination of the bare bones of each one's existence to make a choice.\n\nIn New Delhi, Leela Singh, a closeted homosexual girl leaves her orthodox cop father's home with a mission to kidnap her activist bisexual lover, Sakhi Taylor, and marry her. Not only do the lovers need to come to terms with their own differences, they need to face Devraj, the truth of the society they live in.\n\nSet in the most archetypal cities of economic and patriarchal control, four characters come face to face with gruesome acts of violence in a battle of identities against unfreedom. \"Unfreedom\" examines the struggle between the powerful and powerless and those who strive to stand against dominating torturing socio political injustices.",
