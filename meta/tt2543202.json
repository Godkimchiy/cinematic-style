  "plot": "This section's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (October 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nPrior to the Renaissance, Vlad \u021aepe\u0219 (Luke Evans) is the Prince of Wallachia and Transylvania. As a child, he was a royal hostage in the palace of the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and was trained to be a soldier in the Sultan's elite Janissary corps, where he became their most feared warrior. He was called Vlad the Impaler after slaughtering thousands by impaling them on spears.\n\nNow ruling his domains in peace, Vlad and his soldiers discover a helmet in a stream and fear that an Ottoman scouting party is preparing the way for invasion. The stream leads to Broken Tooth Mountain, the top of which has a cave carpeted in crushed bone. Within the cave they are attacked in the dark by an inhumanly strong and fast humanoid creature (Charles Dance), with shining red eyes and pointed teeth. Vlad's retinue is killed, and the blood of the wounded creature dissolves when exposed to sunlight which scares the creature to not pursue Vlad. Returning to his castle, Vlad learns from a local monk that the creature is a vampire, who was once a man who summoned a demon from the depths of hell for dark powers, before being cursed to remain in the cave until he is released by someone who drinks his blood, then drinks the blood of a human.\n\nVlad celebrates an Easter feast with his wife Mirena (Sarah Gadon) and son \u00cengera\u0219 (Art Parkinson), when an Ottoman contingent arrives at the castle. Vlad offers them the usual tribute payment of silver coins, but the emissary notes that a battalion of Ottoman scouts has gone missing, implying that Vlad has had them killed, and demands an additional tribute of 1,000 boys to be trained as Janissaries, through the dev\u015firme system. Vlad refuses, but his army is small and no match for the Turks.\n\nMirena believes Vlad can convince Sultan Mehmed II to show mercy based on their shared childhood history and brotherly relationship. He approaches Mehmed and asks him not to take the country's boys. When that fails, he offers himself in place of the boys; but the Sultan refuses and demands Vlad's son in addition. The Sultan sends the emissary to bring Vlad's son who tells his father that he is ready to join the Sultan's army, but Vlad kills the emissary and the soldiers with him.\n\nKnowing his actions will lead to war, Vlad returns to the Broken Tooth Mountain cave to seek help from the vampire. The vampire tells him there are consequences and offers him some of his blood, which will temporarily give Vlad the powers of a vampire. If he resists the intense urge to drink human blood for three days, he will turn back into a human. Otherwise, he will remain a vampire forever and will one day be called upon to help his maker seek vengeance on the one who cursed him. Vlad accepts the offer and drinks the vampire's blood, going through a painful and deathlike experience as he transforms.\n\nVlad awakens in the forest and discovers he has been granted heightened senses, inhuman strength and speed, and the ability to transform into a flock of bats; but his skin slowly burns in direct sunlight and silver makes him weak and sick. When he returns to Castle Dracula, the Ottoman army attacks, but Vlad single-handedly kills them all. He then sends most of the castle's subjects to Cozia Monastery for safety.\n\nAs they travel to the monastery, Vlad discovers his thirst for blood while he begins to have sex with Mirena and spots an artery pumping blood in her neck. He stops and resists, apologising to Mirena before fleeing into a nearby forest. There, a Romani named Shkelgim, who knows Vlad is a vampire, proclaims himself as his servant and offers his own blood but Vlad again resists.\n\nMirena learns of Vlad's curse, as she sees him holding silver to keep himself weak when near his people to avoid revealing his condition to them or attack them for blood. As they near the monastery, the Valachs are ambushed by Ottoman soldiers; and, while Vlad and his men successfully repel them, Vlad's sudden increased strength arouses suspicion among his subjects. The next day at the monastery, a monk learns of the curse and leads the Prince's subjects to turn on Vlad, trapping him in a burning building in the sunlight. Black smoke blocks out the sun, allowing an outraged Vlad to escape the fire, and he angrily reveals that he became a vampire for the sole purpose of protecting his people from the Ottoman suzerainty. Before he acts out against them, Mirena stops him and calms him down.\n\nThat night, the Ottoman army marches on the monastery. Vlad commands an enormous swarm of bats to repel them; however, the soldiers are actually a decoy force, allowing a handful of Turks to infiltrate the monastery, kill many of the inhabitants and kidnap Ingeras. Mirena tries to defend her son, and falls from the edge of the monastery wall. Dying, Mirena pleads with Vlad to drink her blood before the sun rises to give him the strength to save their son.\n\nVlad reluctantly drinks her blood, triggering his final transformation into a full-blooded vampire and granting him even greater powers. As he does so, he summons black storm clouds to blot out the sun. The vampire loses his monstrous appearance and walks out of his cave, as his curse is broken. Vlad returns to the monastery and turns a small group of survivors and mortally wounded into vampires as well.\n\nAt the Ottoman army's camp, Mehmed prepares for a massive invasion of Europe. Vlad and his vampires arrive, hidden by a large lightning storm, and easily massacre the terrified Ottoman soldiers, while Vlad himself goes after Mehmed, who is holding \u00cengera\u0219 captive. Aware that vampires are weakened by silver, Mehmed has lined the floor of his tent with silver coins, making Vlad's strength and speed that of a human - and impairing his vision - as Mehmed fights Vlad with a silver sword. He overpowers Vlad and prepares to impale his heart with a wooden stake, but Vlad turns into a flock of bats and evades him. Taking the name \"Dracula, Son of the Devil\", he kills Mehmed with the stake and drinks his blood.\n\nAs they leave Mehmed's tent, Dracula and \u00cengera\u0219 are confronted by the other vampires, who demand that his son be killed because he is human. The monk who had previously led the Valachs against Vlad appears and keeps the vampires at bay with a Christian cross. When one of the vampires attempts to kill \u00cengera\u0219, Dracula impales him with a spear as a warning to the others not to harm his son. Dracula orders the monk to take \u00cengera\u0219 away, then uses his power to clear the black clouds in the sky. The sunlight burns the vampires into dust, while Dracula collapses into a charred corpse. With Vlad presumed dead and Europe saved from the Ottoman invasion, \u00cengera\u0219 is crowned the new Prince of Wallachia. However, Shkelgim secretly takes Dracula into a nearby tent and revives him with his blood.\n\nIn the present day, Vlad meets a woman named Mina, who strikingly resembles Mirena, in the streets of a modern city (London), while the vampire who cursed Vlad watches them from afar. As they walk away, he follows, saying \"Let the games begin\".",
