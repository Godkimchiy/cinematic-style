  "plot": "After being released from prison, convicted felon Max Truemont (played by Josh Holloway) and his fianc\u00e9e Roxanne (played by Sarah Wayne Callies), wish to have a fresh start by running a small diner of their own. However, the bank refuses to loan US$ 50,000.00 to them to open the business, and without alternatives, Max accepts the invitation of his former partner Sydney and his associate Vince to participate in the kidnapping of the eight-year-old David, the son of a wealthy woman in New England, under the command of a mysterious mastermind behind the kidnapping. After the successful abduction of the eight-year-old boy, David (played by Blake Woodruff), the group awaits ransom instructions in a secluded hideout. However, as they begin to become suspicious of each other, Max realizes the boy is not as innocent as he seemed. The boy commands various characters in the movie to kill each other. As the film evolves we learn that the mastermind is none other than the boy's own mother who it turns out had adopted him. She tells Max that the kidnapped boy is a demon. He can suggest or \"whisper\" ideas to weak minded individuals. She pleads with Max to kill the boy on her behalf. On Max's refusal, she kills herself with her own hand gun. In the end, Max kills David, but with the loss of his fiancee Roxanne, who's killed accidentally by Max himself.",
