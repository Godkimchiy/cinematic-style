  "plot": "Part I: Hongsawadee's Hostage\n\nThe film concerns the childhood of King Naresuan. Born in 1555, he was taken to Burma as a child hostage; there he became acquainted with sword fighting and became a threat to the Burmese empire\n\nThe film begins in 1564, during the Burmese siege of Phitsanulok, the center of the languishing Sukhothai kingdom. Naresuan's father, Maha Thammarachathirat, admits defeat and follows Burmese orders that his two sons, Naresuan (nicknamed Ong Dam Thai: \u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c\u0e14\u0e33 Black Prince) and Ekathotsarot (the White Prince), be taken hostage and be raised in Pegu (the center of the Hanthawadi kingdom) under the watchful eyes of Bayinnaung, the Burmese king, who promises to care for Naresuan like one of his own. This creates a rift between Naresuan's father and his mother, Queen Wisutkasat, whose brother is the king of the neighboring Ayutthaya kingdom, as Phitsanulok is now a Burmese vassal state. Ayutthaya falls soon after.\n\nImmediately after entering the Burmese palace, Naresuan sees the palace politics and rivalries between himself and Bayinnaung's grandson, Mingyi Swa. Naresuan is sent to be educated as a novice monk, by an ethnic Mon Buddhist monk named Khanchong, at a Buddhist monastery outside the palace. There, while wandering the Thai village outside Pegu (made up of Thais displaced by Bayinnaung's expansionist campaigns and subsequent forced relocations to Hanthawadi), he befriends Bunthing, a Thai street child who is later allowed to work as a temple boy. He also befriends Maneechan, a temple girl at the monastery. The monk Khanchong, who had also trained Bayinnaung, teaches Naresuan the skills of war and ethics.\nPart II: Reclaiming Sovereignty\n\nBayinnaung dies in the beginning of the film from natural causes. Thammaracha, the governor-king of Ayutthaya, believes it is important that he go and pay respect to the dead king out of fear that the new Burmese king Nanda would deem it as an insult and attack Ayutthaya. Prince Naresuan, however, having been raised in Pegu (the kingdom of Hanthawadi) and who regards Bayinnaung as a second father, convinces Thammaracha to let him go in his place.\n\nUpon arriving in Hanthawadi (Hongsawadi in Thai), Naresuan's childhood teacher, a Buddhist monk named Khan Chong, informs him about the dangers that king Nanda and many factions in Burma are plotting his assassination. At king Bayinnaung's funeral, all representatives from vassal kingdoms are present besides for one, the Krang kingdom. King Nanda sees it as disrespect and seizes the opportunity to wage war and siege the mountain top city. Naresuan's Ayutthaya army is successful in taking the mountain top city and proves itself superior to the rival Burmese armies, namely of the Lord of Pyay and of Mingyi Swa (the eldest son of Nandabayin). Burmese rivals felt even more threatened by the strength and wits of Naresuan's army. During the battle, Naresuan's friend, Bunthing, now a highly skilled general under Naresuan, falls for the princess of Krang, who becomes his companion.\n\nA plot is uncovered by Naresuan's childhood friends, two Mon rulers, that the Burmese are in fact planning the assassination of Naresuan. Upon finding out, Naresuan executes the plotters and ceremoniously declares Ayutthaya free and sovereign from Hanthawadi. King Nanda and his Burmese are furious and begin a military campaign to capture and kill king Naresuan before his forces and liberated Siamese subjects can reach the Sittaung River. King Naresuan uses the strategy of a fighting retreat. His forces built a wooden bridge across the river and engage the pursuing Burmese army as they follow. Several battles took place during the crossing. However, as the Burmese forces catch up, the Siamese citizens and forces have already crossed to the other bank.\n\nThe Burmese, determined to defeat the Siamese, try to pursue Naresuan's forces by crossing the river. The king is then approached by his revered Buddhist teacher, Mon monk Khanchong. Here, he is given a special musket, which is capable of firing across the river. According to history, the movie portrays king Naresuan firing the musket across the Sittaung River, and with one strike, killing the general of the Burmese army. With the general dead, Burmese forces retreated back to Hanthawadi. King Naresuan and his now independent Siamese forces head back to Ayutthaya and the king declares&#160;; \"It's not over yet, there is more work for us to do!\"\nPart III: Naval Battle\n\nIn 1584 at Kraeng, King Naresuan continues the war for independence of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya (Thai&#160;: \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e13\u0e32\u0e08\u0e31\u0e01\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e38\u0e18\u0e22\u0e32). The war began because King Nandabayin king of the Burmese Kingdom(Thai&#160;: \u0e2d\u0e32\u0e13\u0e32\u0e08\u0e31\u0e01\u0e23\u0e1e\u0e21\u0e48\u0e32)had secretly determined to fight a war by sending two armies to attack King Naresuan.

The second army is that of the King Noratra Mangsosri (Thai&#160;: \u0e19\u0e23\u0e18\u0e32\u0e40\u0e21\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e2d) of Lanna (Chiangmai) which attacks from the north of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya.

While two armies are preparing for continuing the war with Ayutthaya, the King of Loverk (Thai&#160;: \u0e25\u0e30\u0e41\u0e27\u0e01) sends Lord Jinjantu(Thai&#160;: \u0e08\u0e34\u0e19\u0e08\u0e31\u0e19\u0e15\u0e38), a Chinese official, to spy in Ayutthaya, but a short time later, he heads back to Lovek because king Naresuan knows that he is a spy. After an intense river battle between Jinjantu's Chinese troops and the Siamese gunboats under Naresuan's personal command, he is able to escape.\n\nWhen the King of Lovek learns about the skills and abilities of Naresuan, he decides to make an alliance with Ayutthaya by sending his reluctant brother, Prince Srisuphanrachathirat (Thai: \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e18\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a) to help Ayutthaya fight against Hanthawadi(Thai&#160;: \u0e2b\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e14\u0e35). While Naresuan prepares for the war, he realizes that the soldiers in the army of Ayutthaya are outnumbered by the two armies of Burma, so he decides to fight with each army separately before the two armies come together. First he fights with army of Lord Pathein west of Ayutthaya and he wins this first battle. Then he fights with the army north of Ayutthaya. After a hard fought battle, King Naresun defeats the army of King Noratra Mangsosri of Lanna (Chiangmai).
