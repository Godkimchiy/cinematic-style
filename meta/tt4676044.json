  "overview": "Kleanthis is working two jobs, and saddled with debts. His boss hates him, his mother-in-law despises him. His life is going nowhere - at least till he's clearing out a room in the antiquities department where he works, and finds a magic mirror with a friendly genie that can make wishes come true. Kleanthis uses the mirror to change his life and get what he wants - but, even though his wishes are granted, something always seems to go wrong.",
  "storyline": "Just how much of a miserable person is Kleanthis, the 35-year-old curator of antiquities? Juggling two jobs to make ends meet and at the end of his tether, the hard-working toiler is patiently waiting until life returns to normal to finally start being happy. However, just when Kleanthis thought that things couldn't get worse, the inadvertent and perfectly extraordinary discovery of a strange dusty mirror with the mystical power to fulfil one's wildest dreams will change his life instantly. But, is this really the solution to his problems? After all, there is always a catch in such bargains with the unknown; moreover--as things spiral out of control--the unsuspecting pipe-dreamer will inevitably realise that, once more, he is totally powerless. As always, be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.",
