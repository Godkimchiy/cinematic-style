Accepting the challenge and telling about it only to his closest friend, Arul arrives in Chennai and as time passes, he forms a strong bind with other beggars in the city. He even comes close to Magizhini, a lady who runs a pizza parlour due to her good nature. Everything goes smooth until the day when he gets caught between deadly goons and his uncle who finds out about him and tries to overtake his business.",
