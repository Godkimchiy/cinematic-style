  "overview": "As the Palaces Burn is a feature-length documentary that originally sought to follow Lamb of God and their fans throughout the world, to demonstrate how music ties us together when we can\u2019t find any other common bond. However, during the filming process in 2012, the story abruptly took a dramatic turn when lead singer Randy Blythe was arrested on charges of manslaughter and blamed for the death of one of their young fans in the Czech Republic. What followed was a heart-wrenching courtroom drama that left fans, friends, and curious onlookers around the world on the edge of their seats.",
  "storyline": "Lamb of God, whose fanbase continues to grow on a daily basis, giving them the number two album in the country behind Taylor Swift, set out to make a movie about how their genre of music has gone global. Midway through filming, lead singer Randy Blythe was arrested and charged with manslaughter in the Czech republic. This caused the project, which was originally meant for fans, to drastically switch tracks, turning it into an edge-of-your-seat legal thriller.",
