  "storyline": "Depressed Sally, 17, is locked up at Teenland. A pink, prison-like institution for teens who are so fucked emotionally that they have developed supernatural powers. Everything changes when Sally encounters power sociopath Ting- e-ling, who convinces Sally that she must use her skills and dare to loose control. This is what teenagers do! When playing a provocative sexual play, the two girls are punished. Sally wakes up in a world far from the pink prison she knows. Instead the institution is bleak and she has momentarily slipped out of her psychosis. But Sally is changed, and when she is reminded that the institution has captured her friend, she decides to save Ting- e- Ling by using her special powers. The rebellion has begun.",
