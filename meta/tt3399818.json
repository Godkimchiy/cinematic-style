When he was only barely a year old, he was almost run over by a rushing bus while playing with a football. However, Tsubasa held the ball in front of him which served as a cushion for most of the impact. The force of the bump blew him away, but he was able to right himself with the ball. Hence, Tsubasa Oozora's motto of \"The ball is my friend\". Ever since he was little, he always went out with a football. His mother concludes that he was indeed born to only play football. At a very young age, Tsubasa Oozora already had amazing speed, stamina, dribbling skills and shotpower - he astounded anyone who saw him play.\n\nAt the beginning of the story, Tsubasa and his mom both move to the city of Nankatsu, a town well known for their talented elementary school football teams and where Tsubasa meets Ryo Ishizaki, a football-loving young student who often sneaks out from his mother's public bath houses and chores to play football.
