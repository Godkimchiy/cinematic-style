  "overview": "A young woman returns to her birthplace after her father's death and unearths distant memories and long-buried secrets that change everything she thought she knew about her family, past and herself.",
  "storyline": "Still reeling from a rocky divorce and the recent death of her father, Clair Defina, a 33 year-old New York writer, needs a change. Her best friend, Isolda, suggests they drive up the coast of Maine to the remote northern region where Claire spent her early childhood. Clair and her father left when she was six, following the tragic death of her mother in a fire, and she hasn't returned since. Arriving in the quaint but dilapidated seaside town of Edgeport, Clair meets an eclectic group of locals, many of whom once lived on a nearby commune with her parents in the 1970s. She's surprised when they tell her she has family her father never told her about, a 90 year old great Aunt Dora living out on a farm at the edge of town with her daughter Alice. Over the next 48 hours, Clair must deal with an increasingly dangerous present while delving into the murky past. As she comes face to face with the toxic legacy that has been buried beneath the town- literally and figuratively-for decades, ...",
  "plot": "Marco (Vincent Lindon), a sailor who has cut off ties with most of his family, returns home after the suicide of his brother-in-law. At the urging of his sister Sandra (Julie Bataille), who believes that her husband\u2019s death was caused by one of their creditors, Marco tries to avenge his family. He moves in to an apartment above that occupied by the creditor, Edouard Laporte, and begins an affair with his wife, Rapha\u00eblle (Chiara Mastroianni). Marco discovers that his sister is deep in debt and that his niece, Justine (Lola Cr\u00e9ton), has been hospitalized and might need reconstructive surgery as her vagina has been badly damaged. After some investigation he believes that Laporte was the one who injured his niece by penetrating her with a corn cob.\n\nJustine eventually runs away from the hospital she was staying at and friends of hers offer Marco access to images of her going to a sex club with Laporte and her father. After viewing the images Marco realizes that both his sister and his brother-in-law allowed Laporte to use their daughter for sexual favours in return for money to keep their failing shoe factory afloat. Justine and her friends leave together but she deliberately crashes the car they are driving, killing them all.\n\nMeanwhile Laporte, discovering that Rapha\u00eblle and Marco are sleeping together, leaves her, taking their young son with him. When he returns to collect a few of his son\u2019s things and to tell Rapha\u00eblle that he is moving to Geneva with the boy, Marco tries to stop him. In the ensuing fight Marco is shot and killed by Rapha\u00eblle.\n\nSandra receives a video in the mail which she watches with Justine\u2019s doctor. It is a sex tape involving Justine, her father, Laporte and another woman. The tape shows Justine\u2019s father holding a corn cob.",
