  "overview": "Akago (Fumi Nikaido) is a red goldfish able to change into a girl. She possesses a pure and sensuous side. She lives with an old male writer (Ren Osugi) whom she calls  \u201cOjisama.\u201d  One day, the ghost of Yuriko Tamura (Yoko Maki) appears. She is a woman the writer knew in the past.",
  "storyline": "Based on novelist Muro Saisei's 1959 book, Bitter Honey narrates the story of a poet who informed by his physician of his impending death finds renewed flights of fantasy. He is visited by a thin and attractive girl in red who becomes a catalyst for romance. The girl has to vie with competition for the artist's attention, however, as other women work in the wings. Bitter Honey's story is coloured by gorgeous photography as it explores sex, love, life and immortality.",
