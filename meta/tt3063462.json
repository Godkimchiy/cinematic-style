  "storyline": "Seventeen-year-old Alex Taylor dreams of running for his high school's cross-country team, a dream that's a bit out of reach for this gifted runner as Alex has been blind since the age of two. Determined to run, he practices with his father, Probation Officer Geoff Taylor. Geoff, with additional girth and age working against him, finds he no longer can keep up with his son. He must find a running partner at the school who's fast enough to help Alex make the cross-country team. This help comes from the unlikeliest of sources. Brad Coleman, a schoolmate of Alex's, spends most of his time running from the law. Caught in a pathetic daytime robbery attempt, Brad faces incarceration for repeat offenses. To keep Brad out of jail and in school, Geoff makes a deal and pairs the two boys, opposite in many ways. Despite a rocky start over their many differences, an unlikely friendship forms.",
  "plot": "See also: Operation Red Wings\nIn Afghanistan, Taliban leader Ahmad Shah is responsible for killing over twenty United States Marines, as well as villagers and refugees who were aiding American forces. In response to these killings, a United States Navy SEALs unit is ordered to execute a counter-insurgent mission to capture Shah. As part of the mission, a four-man SEAL reconnaissance and surveillance team is tasked with locating Shah. These four SEALs include team leader Michael P. \"Murph\" Murphy; snipers Marcus Luttrell and Matthew \"Axe\" Axelson; and communications specialist Danny Dietz.\n\nThe team is inserted into the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, where they make a trek through the mountains. Here, they begin to encounter communications problems, which would play a critical role in the following events. Upon arriving at their designated location, the SEALs are accidentally discovered by an elderly shepherd and two teenage goat herders. Knowing that if they release them, the herders will likely alert Taliban to their presence, the team is split about whether to execute the herders or not. After a brief debate, Luttrell convinces the others that they will incite backlash if they kill the three herders. The team decides to release the herders and abort the mission, but before they can escape, they are discovered by Taliban forces. Although they manage to kill several Taliban soldiers, they find themselves heavily outnumbered and at a significant tactical disadvantage. Each of the men suffers serious injuries during the firefight, and in an attempt to flee from the insurgents, they jump off the edge of a precipitous ridge and into a large ravine.\n\nDespite their injuries, the SEALs continue a defensive retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from the Taliban fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is shot in the shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains at the top of the cliff and is killed by the Taliban insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up the cliff to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the Taliban fighters to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by Taliban fighters.\n\nIn response to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and heads toward the location without fighter escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot down one of the helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land at the bottom of a rock crevice where he is able to hide from the Taliban fighters.\n\nLuttrell stumbles upon a small body of water and submerges himself, only to find upon surfacing that a local Pashtun villager, Mohammad Gulab, has discovered his location. Gulab takes Luttrell into his care, returning to his village, where he attempts to hide Luttrell in his home. Gulab then sends a mountain man to the nearest American air base to alert military forces of Luttrell's location. The Taliban fighters arrive at the village to capture and kill Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill the fighters if they harm Luttrell. The fighters leave, but later return to punish the villagers for protecting Luttrell. Gulab and his fellow militia are able to fend off several fighters during the ensuing attack. American forces, arriving via helicopters, shatter the advancing Taliban and, in the process, kill the bulk of the insurgents with concentrated weaponry fire. The American forces evacuate Luttrell back to base.\n\nPhotos of the real-life Marcus Luttrell, Mohammad Gulab and the fallen service members who died during the mission are shown during a four-minute montage, and an epilogue reveals that the Pashtun villagers agreed to help Luttrell as part of a traditional code of honor known as the Pashtunwali.",
  "synopsis": "Sixteen year old Alex Taylor dreams of flying. He also dreams of running for his high schools cross-country track team. Both dreams seem equally out of his reach, as Alex has been blind since the age of two. Alex, determined to run, practices with his father, Probation Officer Geoff Taylor. Geoff, with additional girth and age working against him, finds that he no longer can keep up with his son, a very gifted runner. He must find a running partner at the school fast enough to help Alex make the cross-country team. This help comes from the unlikeliest of sources. Living on an aboriginal reserve in British Columbia, Canada, Brad Coleman, schoolmate of Alexs, spends most of his time running from the law. Brad is caught in a pathetic daytime robbery attempt and faces incarceration for repeat offenses. Geoff makes a deal to keep Brad out of jail and back in school. He pairs the two boys, opposite in many ways, together. And despite a rocky start because of their many differences, an unlikely friendship develops.\nBrought together by circumstance, all Alex and Brad must do now is overcome the opposition and prejudices of the track coach, teammates, Alexs overprotective mother and even themselves for Alex to make his exciting climatic run at the County championship."
