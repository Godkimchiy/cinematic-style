  "storyline": "Sam Ellis is a man on the rise - a federal prosecutor on the cusp of a bright political future. But what was meant to be a one-time experience with a high-end escort instead turns into a growing addiction.

  "plot": "Sam Ellis (Patrick Wilson) is a man on the rise \u2013 a hot-shot prosecutor on the cusp of a bright future. When an intern (Dianna Agron) at the office becomes infatuated with him, Sam unwisely attempts to quiet his desires by seeing a high class escort \u2014 only to discover that the experience is more fulfilling and exhilarating than he could have imagined. A second appointment with an escort soon follows, and a third, sending his once idyllic life spiraling out of control. In the midst of wrestling with his demons, he suddenly finds himself being groomed to run for Attorney General \u2014 thrusting him into the public spotlight, and forcing him to take increasingly dangerous measures to keep the press, the law and his wife (Lena Headey) off his trail.",
