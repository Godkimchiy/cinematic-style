She's been living on donations and lectures ever since. Thirty years ago, the police believed that a satanic cult was responsible for the murder of her mother and two sisters, and her brother Ben was convicted with her testimony in court. Today, however, an acquaintance, Lyle Wirth, invites Libby to visit \"The Kill Club\", where amateurs investigate famous crimes, and she finds that they believe Ben is innocent.

  "synopsis": "Set in a farming town in Kansas, Dark Places follows Libby Day (Charlize Theron), the only surviving witness of a horrific massacre that took her mother and sisters. Believing the slaughter to be the work of a Satanic cult, Libby testifies in court against her own brother. 25 years after the murder, she remains haunted by the gruesome violence of her past when she meets a group of amateur investigators who call themselves 'The Kill Club.' Looking to satisfy their morbid curiosity, the group begins their own inquiry about the case, believing Libby's brother innocent. In order to help them, Libby must unearth painful memories of the event, and learn that her past may not be what it seems.Adapted from a bestselling mystery novel written by Gillian Flynn in 2009, Dark Places is not only a mystery thriller but an examination of poverty, abuse, and neglect running rampant in rural America."
