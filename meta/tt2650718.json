  "overview": "Fred lives on his own. His wife is dead, his son has left. He leans on the church, busses, meat-and-two-veg. Then Leo appears. Leo is a tramp. Fred lets Leo move in with him. An absurdist feature debut with a laugh and a tear in stuffy Netherlands.",
  "storyline": "Devout Calvinist widower Fred leads a respectable, utterly boring life since he evicted his only son. Suddenly arrives Theo, a mentally impaired adult, mental age about five. Fred starts enjoying 'fathering' again, becomes protective and even defends him against bully urchins and the pretentious bigot sexton. When Theo asks to 'wed' Fred, both grumpy men's darkest secrets and regrets have to be dealt with.",
