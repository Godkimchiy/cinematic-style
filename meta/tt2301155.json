  "plot": "In a police van, Afaaque Baaghran (Anil Kapoor) listens to the story narrated by a gangster, Manya Surve (John Abraham), who is gravely injured with a bullet-riddled body.\n\nSurve is a decent student of Kirti College, Dadar. He is in love with Vidya Joshi (Kangana Ranaut) and takes her to his mother to discuss their marriage. Manya has an older brother Bhargav Surve who is a gangster after an underworld don named Bhatkar (Ranjeet).\n\nSoon enough, Bhargav is attacked and beaten up by Bhatkar's goons. Manya jumps in to save him. While Manya Surve clutches one of the goons, Bhargav stabs the goon and he dies on the spot. On the day of Manya's exam results, before he can discover his grades, Manya and his brother are arrested and publicly humiliated at college by Insp. Ambolkar (Raju Kher) and end up in Yerwada Prison. In prison, another convict named Munir (Tusshar Kapoor) saves Manya from being attacked by a goon named Potya (Chetan Hansraj) during lunch time. In this assault, Bhargav is killed. Munir befriends Manya and another convict named Veera. Veera trains Manya to become stronger. Manya trains and then eventually is challenged by Potya. Potya attacks him from behind and beats Manya up, to which Manya responds by stabbing Potya to his death.\n\nLater on, both Manya and Munir escape from the prison while they were working on a railway track and try to join hands with two brothers who rule Mumbai's deals. The first brother, Zubair Imtiaz Haksar (Manoj Bajpayee), is cool and is impressed by Manya. However, the second brother, Dilawar (Sonu Sood), disapproves of Manya and dislikes him. After this Manya forms his own gang which consists of him, Munir, Veera and Gyancho, a sharpshooter brought by Munir. Soon enough, Manya finishes off Bhatkar (the gangster who had him and his brother arrested). Jamal, Bhatkar's bodyguard also joins them. Next Manya brings Ambolkar to his knees by beating him brutally in public. The story next shows the death of Sadiq, (Arif Zakaria) an unscrupulous news reporter by Mastan. This breaks a fight between Haskar brothers and Mastan. Due to this a truce is called by Haji Maqsood (Akbar Khan). The truce is short lived as Mastan asks Manya Surve to finish Zubair. After Zubair's assassination, Dilawar kills Gyancho with the help of Jamal. He is about to kill Munir when Manya saves him. Later Afaaque is asked to kill Manya by Dilawar. Even after his refusal at first he agrees when police commissioner (Jackie Shroff) orders him to. The story comes to an end after the shootout and Manya's killing.",
