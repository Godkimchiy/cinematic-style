  "overview": "One of the greatest neuroscience breakthroughs is having discovered that babies are far more than a genetic load. The development of all human beings lies on the combination of genetics, the quality of the relationships and the environment they are set on.  The Beginning of Life invites everyone to reflect: are we taking good care of this unique moment, which defines both the present and future of humankind?",
  "storyline": "Discoveries in neuroscience can help us understand childhood development. When a person is born, it is more than just a genetic load. We are formed by our relationship with everything around us combined with our genetics, The Beginning of Life investigates what separates us and what is essential to all of us, how we can create a better world by investing in the first years of our lives.",
