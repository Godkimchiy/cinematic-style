  "storyline": "A sequel to a Czech cult film Bony a klid (1988) about a group of money dealers, who trafficked foreign currencies and so called \"bony\" during the Communist era. Bony served as exchange vouchers used in shops with otherwise unavailable goods from Western countries. Any unauthorized trading of these currencies was punishable by law. However, as long as the police also got its cut, everyone kept quiet. Twenty five years later the group of small time criminals is back. They quickly shook the demise of their lucrative r\u00e9gime business off and adapted to a new market. They now specialize in governmental and European Union funding. A new young protagonist Martin (Jakub Prachar) who, like his predecessor, comes from a small city to Prague is dragged into their shady dealings...",
  "plot": "This section describes a work or element of fiction in a primarily in-universe style. Please help rewrite it to explain the fiction more clearly and provide non-fictional perspective. (April 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\nIn the film, which takes place in Prague, a young man from Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, Martin (Jan Potm\u011b\u0161il) becomes a victim of a fraud by Richard (Josef Nedorost), a money dealer (trading foreign currencies was illegal in Czechoslovakia during the socialist era). Because he wants his money back, he attempts to track Richard down and eventually joins his gang, consisting of Hary (Tom\u00e1\u0161 Han\u00e1k), B\u00edny (Roman Skamene) and Slepej\u0161 (Miloslav Kope\u010dn\u00fd). He quickly adapts to the environment of big money, debaucherous parties, prostitutes, and police raids. B\u00edny betrays one of their deals to a rival gang, lead by Karel (Franti\u0161ek \u0160vihl\u00edk), and they find themselves on the run from the police. They attempt to seek shelter in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, but are eventually found and during the chase, Hary falls to his death from a balcony. The gang appears in court and is sentenced to serve jail time. It is strongly suggested that Karel has an influence over the judge.",
