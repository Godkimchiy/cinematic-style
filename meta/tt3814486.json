  "storyline": "Bloed, Zweet en Tranen (Blood, Sweat and Tears) is a story about the life of Andre Hazes, a Dutch populair singer. This movie shows three crucial phases in the life of Hazes: his youth ('60's), his breakthrough ('80's) and the last year of his life (early '00).",
  "plot": "The movie focuses on three stages in Hazes' life and are shown in no particular order.\nAs an 8-year-old, Hazes is ordered by his aggressive father Joop to sing in pubs and at markets. Joop uses the collected money to buy his drinks and even forces his son to drink beer. One day the famous John Kraaijkamp Sr. hears Andr\u00e9 singing at the Albert Cuyp Market. He tries to convince Joop to have Andr\u00e9 on national television. Joop is not impressed; he thinks that his other son sings much better, until he finds out about the financial benefits. The performance is a success and subsequently Hazes records two duets with Kraaijkamp (Droomschip and Guanita) for single-release; it makes no impact.As an adult, Hazes runs a pub and builds up a reputation as \"singing bartender\". He enjoys his first chart-hit with Eenzame kerst (Lonely Christmas) which is distributed by Philips Records. When Hazes ends this collaboration, EMI sends Tim Griek - one of their producers - to the pub to convince Hazes to join them. Hazes initlally declines because he's expected to sing levenslied (Dutch sentimental songs about everyday life) instead of his beloved blues; but he changes his mind when Griek convinces him that the time is not right to record a blues album (that would happen in the late 1980s). Hazes becomes close friends with Griek although they have their tensions which are often caused by Hazes' excessive drinking alcohol abuse. The friendship temporarily ends when Hazes reveals that he has an affair with a fifteen-year-old girl called Rachel. Soon afterwards Griek gets involved in a car accident and drowns in the nearby river.In his final stage Hazes prepares for his farewell performance in Amsterdam Arena which is scheduled for September 27, 2004. This is not an easy task because of his addiction to alcohol (mainly Heineken) and cigarettes (mainly Camel); he also suffers from deafness and diabetes. A few weeks before this final performance he even had to stop his show as he was too drunk; his health declines. On September 21, 2004 a sick Hazes falls into coma whilst dreaming about his performance in Amsterdam Arena. He passes away two days later. The farewell performance does take place but becomes a tribute.",
