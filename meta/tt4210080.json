  "overview": "Eight year old Anthony is somewhat uneasy about spending the weekend with his alcoholic, down-on-his-luck carpenter dad Walt while his mom Bonnie and her new husband Kyle go to a Catholic retreat together. Walt is just as uneasy about spending time with Anthony, especially since their first day together is a series of characteristically unfortunate events, including his truck breaking down, his landlord locking him out of the house, and the theft of his toolbox, which he needs for an upcoming job. As Walt and Anthony set about finding the guy who stole the tools and improvise around their other misfortunes, they begin to discover a true connection with each other, causing Walt to become a better father and Anthony to reveal the promise and potential of the good man he will become.",

  "plot": "Anita Hill tells the Senate Judiciary Committee that, inter alia, Clarence Thomas had spoken to her about pornographic movies and actors such as Long Dong Silver. A psychologist tells a U.S. senator that Anita Hill has erotomania. The subpoena to Angela Wright, another accuser of Thomas, is withdrawn.",
  "synopsis": "The film takes place over one weekend. While the mother and her new husband attend a 'couple's retreat' she gives her son to his biological father. The mother reluctantly hands her son over to a man she divorced because of his alcoholism. All Anthony (the son) knows about his father is what he was told by his wife Bonnie. Once alone, Walt (the carpenter father) and Anthony have a series of adventures (the father's truck breaks down, he is evicted from his home) and misadventures (his carpentry tools are stolen). The tools were stolen while Walt was in a bar. This only confirms what Anthony was told by his mother. That is where the father/son escapade starts. The movie follows their efforts to get the tools back. Walt and Anthony run into a weird cast of characters in their adventure to retrieve the tools. The trip allows them to form a bond where none existed before. At the end of the weekend, father, son, and mother have all grown as individuals but the father/son relationship has developed the most."
