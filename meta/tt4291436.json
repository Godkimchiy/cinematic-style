Each is miserable due to not achieving his or her goals. Meanwhile, Mae's parents (Jaja Mihardja and Meriam Bellina), realise that their daughter has never acted feminine nor begun working, which they fear will make her undesirable to prospective husbands.

When the athlete tells his boss, Rendy (Richard Kevin), about Mae, the latter decides to visit. She falls in love at first sight. Rendy, who is being hounded by his mother to marry quickly, is tall, handsome, wealthy, and well educated. Rendy, who is looking for a girl like no other, likewise falls in love with Mae. As Eman, who is standing watch, is colour blind, he misinterprets the signal and together with Beni and Guntoro he accosts Rendy and pummels him.\n\nMae's mother, distraught that Mae has still not married, falls ill and threatens to return as a ghost. Mae promises to marry quickly, and tells Eman, Beni, and Guntoro to choose who should marry her. In a competition, it is decided that Guntoro should be the groom. However, after he and Eman fall ill, Ben is chosen.
