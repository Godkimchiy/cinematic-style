His girlfriend, Alice, is his rock, but the magazine she writes for is going down and the pressure is on to find a story.  While job hunting online, David stumbles across the perfect antidote to his boredom: a \u2018Swingers\u2019 site. The resulting inbox of lewd invitations on the home-laptop justifiably upsets Alice, until she realises this could be just the \u2018story\u2019 she needs.  The idea of uncovering the swinging scene causes quite a stir in Alice\u2019s office and, much to David\u2019s chagrin, she is urged to pursue the story.  Their first reluctant foray is an hysterically low-rent initiation, however, an unexpected upturn for David\u2019s manhood is all the extra encouragement they need.  As events accelerate beyond their control the once adoring couple become lost and fundamental questions are asked of their relationship.",
