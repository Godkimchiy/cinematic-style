  "overview": "One-time teen lovers reunite when the woman reveals the man to be the father of her daughter.",
  "storyline": "THE SHAPE OF REX begins with Rose, a married woman in her late thirties, visiting her old, married boyfriend Rex for the first time in over twenty years to tell him, finally, that he is the father of her daughter. The film follows the events that are triggered by that visit, coupled with a parallel recounting of their coming-of-age love story in the 1980s. Rex and Rose (Ryan Hollyman and Monica Dotter, who also happen to be a married couple in real life) are married to others, but their marriages are rocked when they fall into an illicit affair based upon the long-suppressed and unresolved issues of their youthful romance. In a parallel story set in the mid 1980s, young Rex and Rose (Vivien Endicott-Douglas and Brett Donahue) are teenage lovers who bare their souls in a confessional ritual just before being irreparably torn apart by a raging father (J.D. Nicholsen). This is a story about the nature of love, about people who love each other in ways that cannot be reciprocated. The ...",
  "plot": "As a frame story, Wells claims that the book is his edited version of notes written by an eminent diplomat, Dr Philip Raven, who had been having dream visions of a history textbook published in 2106 and wrote down what he could remember of it. It is split into five separate sections or \"books\":\nToday And Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration Dawns \u2013 The history of the world up to 1933.The Days After Tomorrow: The Age of Frustration \u2013 1933\u20131960.The World Renaissance: The Birth of the Modern State \u2013 1960\u20131978.The Modern State Militant \u2013 1978\u20132059.The Modern State in Control of Life \u2013 2059 to New Year's Day 2106.\nThe Shape of Things to Come was written as a future history. Seen in retrospect, it can be considered as an alternative history, diverging from reality in late 1933 or early 1934, the point of divergence being US President Franklin D. Roosevelt's failure to implement the New Deal and revive the US economy and Adolf Hitler's failure to revive the German economy by rearmament. Instead, the worldwide economic crisis continues for thirty years, concurrently with the war, as described above.\n\nWells predicted a Second World War breaking out with a European conflagration from the flashpoint of a violent clash between Germans and Poles at Danzig. Wells set the date for this as January 1940. Poland proves a military match for Nazi Germany and they engage in an inconclusive war lasting ten years. More countries are eventually dragged into the fighting, but France and the Soviet Union are only marginally involved, Britain remains neutral, and the United States fights inconclusively with Japan. The Austrian Anschluss happens during, rather than before, the war. Czechoslovakia avoids German occupation and its president, Edvard Bene\u0161, survives to initiate the final \"Suspension of Hostilities\" in 1950. The war ends with no victor but total exhaustion, collapse and disintegration of all the fighting states and of the neutral countries, equally affected by the deepening economic crisis. The whole world descends into chaos: nearly all governments break down, and a devastating plague in 1956 and 1957 kills a large part of humanity and almost destroys civilisation.\n\nWells then envisages a benevolent dictatorship, \"The Dictatorship of the Air\", arising from the controllers of the world's surviving transport systems, who are the only people with global power. This dictatorship promotes science, enforces Basic English as a global lingua franca and eradicates all religions, setting the world on the road to a peaceful utopia. When the dictatorship chooses to murder a subject, the condemned person is given a chance to take a poison tablet.\n\nEventually, after about 100 years of reshaping humanity, the dictatorship is overthrown in a completely bloodless coup, the former rulers are sent into a very honourable retirement, and the world state \"withers away\". The last part of the book is a detailed description of the utopian world that emerges. The ultimate aim of this utopian world is to produce a world society composed entirely of polymaths, each and every one of its members the intellectual equal of the greatest geniuses of the past.\n\nThe book displays one of the earliest uses of the abbreviation \"C.E.\", which Wells explains as \"Christian Era\", but it is now more usually understood as \"Common Era\".",
