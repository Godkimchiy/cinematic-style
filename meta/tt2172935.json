  "overview": "Trip, a young roadie for Metallica, is sent on an urgent mission during the band's show. But what seems like a simple assignment turns into a surreal adventure.",
  "storyline": "A young Metallica roadie named Trip (Dane DeHaan) embarks on an apocalyptic journey through a decimated urban landscape as the band plays to a sold-out arena crowd in this high-concept concert film from director Nimrod Antal (Predators). As the band takes the stage before thousands of screaming fans, Trip is informed that a driver tasked with delivering a crucial item has gotten stranded on the other side of the city. It's his job to recover it, but getting there won't be easy because as the elaborate concert gets underway, rioters and police begin clashing in the streets. The city is burning, and a mysterious, masked figure on horseback is thriving on the chaos. When Trip incurs the wrath of the ruthless, hammer-wielding psycho and his marauding gang, he realizes that he may not live long enough to complete his mission. Meanwhile, the show must go on, and Metallica thrills the crowd with a thunderous collection of classics that include \"Creeping Death\", \"Ride the Lightning\", \"Master ...",
  "plot": "Amid aerial footage of Vancouver and BC Place stadium, a radio DJ publicizes Metallica's concert. An overweight heavy-metal fan drives into the empty parking lot, and climbs on the car's hood, whooping and laughing. Trip (Dane DeHaan), a roadie for Metallica, skateboards past the fan and wipes out. He skates into the underground parking lot and down the dressing-room halls, encountering each of the band members. When he gives a brown paper bag to his supervisor, Trip is told to stick around. After standing in the arena, he walks away as the audience files in to Metallica's traditional opener, \"Ecstasy of Gold\".\n\nThe band begins performing, and during \"Creeping Death\" Trip's boss tells him to bring gas to a stranded truck carrying \"something very important\". Before driving his van, Trip takes a blue-and-red capsule, before the band begins For Whom the Bell Tolls.\n\nAs Metallica begins \"Fuel\", Trip drives down deserted streets. Distracted by his map, he runs a red light and sees a bloody hand print on an illuminated sign. He is T-boned, and his van flips, lightning flashing as he leaves, which leads into Ride the Lightning (alongside a steel electric chair surrounded by two Tesla coils reminiscent of the album's artwork.)\n\nTrip crawls out of the van, peers into the other car and calls to the driver (who is standing with his back to him). The driver glances at Trip, and runs past him down the street, One beginning to be played. Trip retrieves the gas tank, the map and a doll with a noose around its neck from the van, which The Memory Remains is played to. He wanders down a street, and a police horse drags a dead officer across his path. People run past him, ignoring him, followed by police cruisers (one of which is ablaze). Emerging in the middle of a street, Trip realizes he is between a motionless group of rioters and riot police. The rioters then become rowdy, and when the police throw tear gas they swarm over them. Stunned by the violence, Trip stands in front of a window (which then shatters).\n\nA rider in a gas mask on an armored horse charges, wielding a sledgehammer. He lassos a rioter, hanging him from a streetlamp. Trip throws a brick at the rider, who gives chase. Trip loses the doll, but escapes through a wall of rioters, surging into Cyanide.\n\nHe walks down a deserted, littered street, under a dozen bodies hanging from a pedestrian bridge, leading into ...And Justice for All. Trip finds the truck he is looking for in a deserted parking-garage corridor, but the driver (a middle-aged man) is traumatized and does not notice him. The back of the truck contains a leather bag, which Trip opens; he slumps, speechless, as the band breaks into Master of Puppets\n\nHe sees a figure waving at him from a distance. The rider approaches the figure, and a group of rioters surge past them. Trip grabs the bag and the can of gas, jumps out of the truck and flees.\n\nHe is cornered at the end of an alley by the rioters. Trip ties a black bandanna around his mouth, puts up his hood and drops the bag. He douses himself with the gas, sets himself ablaze and charges the rioters, who eventually overwhelm him, beginning Battery.\n\nAfter the band finishes Nothing Else Matters, Trip wakes up (to \"Enter Sandman\") on the roof of a building; his lost doll, now animated, approaches the leather bag. As Trip gets up, he is lassoed and pulled onto the rider's horse. He grabs the rider's hammer to free himself and slams the roof with it. Shock waves rumble across the city, shattering glass and the exteriors of surrounding buildings and disintegrating the rider and his horse. The reverberation affects Metallica's concert, cutting the power and knocking down lighting trusses. With a backup generator, the band continues the concert without pyrotechnics and a light show, playing Hit the Lights.\n\nTrip returns to the deserted stadium with the doll and the bag under his arm. The credits roll to scenes of the band performing \"Orion\" to the empty stadium. Trip takes a seat; the final shot is of the still-closed leather bag which belonged to Cliff Burton on the Master of Puppets tour.",
  "synopsis": "The film opens with aerial footage of Vancouver and\u00a0BC Place stadium\u00a0with a radio DJ announcing Metallica's one-night-only concert. It then cuts to a heavy-metal fan driving into the empty parking lot and climbing on to the car's hood, whooping and laughing, but has difficulty due to his excessive weight. The film's main protagonist,\u00a0Trip\u00a0(Dane DeHaan)\u00a0skates\u00a0past the fan but wipes out. Trip is a\u00a0roadie\u00a0for Metallica. Skating into the underground parking, he gets a brown paper bag of something unknown from a beatup van and, venturing into the dressing room halls, encounters each of the band members. Giving the bag to his supervisor, Trip is told to \"stick around.\" Standing in the main stadium arena, he then walks at a typical pace with the audience filing in to the arena in a time lapse to Metallica's traditional opener,\u00a0Ecstasy of Gold.Metallica appears on stage and begins performing, and during\u00a0Creeping Death, Trip's manager tasks him with bringing gas to a stranded truck carrying \"something very important.\" Before driving his van, Trip ingests an unknown pill, alluded as a\u00a0drug.As Metallica begins\u00a0Fuel, Trip drives through the deserted streets with Metallica-esque flames on flat surfaces of the cityscape, alluding to the pill's effects or supernatural energy. Distracted by studying his map, Trip runs a red light but brakes late in the intersection's middle when he noticed a bloody hand smear on an illuminated sign. He gets t-boned by another driver, which subsequently flips the van.Crawling out of the van, Trip peers into the other car and, hearing radio reports of what's happening, calls to the unresponsive driver, who is standing with his back to Trip. The driver only briefly looks at Trip and start running past him, down the street. From the truck, Trip retrieves only a gas tank, a map, and a doll of unknown importance with a\u00a0noose\u00a0around its neck. As he exits, electricity crackles in the van from an unrevealed source, as a reference to the band's album,\u00a0Ride The Lightning, as the title song off the album begins. Trip wanders down a street and a\u00a0Police horse\u00a0drags a dead officer across its path. After this, some people begin to run past him, oblivious, and some police cruisers speed past him, one ablaze. Emerging into the middle of a street, he realizes he has wandered between a large group of rioters and riot police, who are motionless. Gradually, the rioters start getting rowdier and more provocative, and when the police fire tear gas, the rioters swarm the police, in a full-on battle. Trip, stunned by the ferocity of the violence, stands by a window being strangely ignored. Suddenly, the window shatters behind Trip.In the heat of battle, a horseman (listed in the credits as\u00a0The Rider, and known by some as \"The Death Dealer\") wearing a gas mask comes charging through, wielding a\u00a0sledgehammer\u00a0atop an armored horse. He pursues a rioter, lassoing his neck and hoisting the victim on a streetlamp, killing him. It is not formally indicated for which side The Rider fights. Enraged by this, Trip throws a brick at The Rider. This fixates The Rider on Trip, and he starts to pursue Trip, who loses the doll. Trip manages to evade The Rider by sneaking through a wall of rioters.Walking down a deserted street that is littered from an earlier battle, Trip walks under a dozen hanging bodies from a pedestrian bridge; it is unrevealed as to how they got there. Trip finds the truck he was tasked to give fuel to in a deserted parking garage corridor, but the driver, a middle aged man, is too traumatized in the cab to heed the presence of Trip. The back of the truck is opened with nothing but a leather bag which Trip opens, but the camera pans away. Trip just slumps down, speechless.Sitting around, Trip notices a figure waving at him from a distance. The Rider rides up behind the man, and suddenly a swarm of mobbers surge past the two. It is left unstated if they are the pre-encountered rioters or The Rider's minions (assuming The Rider is a supernatural entity). Trip then grabs the bag and tank of gas, jumps out of the truck, and flees.Unable to shake off the pack of mobbers, Trip is cornered at the end of an alley with the mobbers closing on him. For an unexplained reason, Trip ties a red bandanna around his mouth, puts up his hoodie, and drops the bag. Picking up the gas tank, Trip pours the gas onto himself and sets himself ablaze, and then charges the mobbers, being beaten collectively.Trip wakes on a building rooftop (with\u00a0Enter Sandman\u00a0starting), while the doll he lost has become animated and is walking to the leather bag. As Trip is getting up, a noose is lassoed on Trip, and he is pulled upon The Rider's horse. Trip grabs The Rider's hammer to free himself. The Rider rides to the opposite end of the rooftop and starts to charge Trip, who picks up the hammer and slams the floor with it, sending unexplained earthquake-style shock waves across the city, shattering all the glass and structural exteriors of surrounding buildings and disintegrating The Rider and his steed to dust. This also has the effect of reverberating throughout Metallica's concert, interrupting it with a blackout of power, and causing lighting trusses to fall. The concert staff eventually hook up a back-up generator, and the band continues the concert without the pyrotechnics and light props.Trip arrives back at the stadium with the doll and the bag under his arm, finding the arena deserted with the concert either over or yet to start. During the credits, intercut scenes of the band performing\u00a0Orion\u00a0play to the deserted stadium. When Trip walks through the venue and takes a seat wearing his same clothes, the ending shot is the leather bag, which is never opened."
