  "storyline": "The life of a young boy, Sathyadev, takes a destined route when his father becomes an incidental casualty in a scene of crime. The I.P.S. route takes away from him, a loving wife-to-be and renders a child motherless. It also gives him a prominent enemy, Victor, who makes a comeback into his life as the perpetrator when he is attempting to solve a kidnap case. And like the narrative tells at that very moment - 'All hell breaks loose' and culminates in a riotous climax.",
