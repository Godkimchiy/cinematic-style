  "storyline": "The Swedish farmer Stig-Anders Svensson who lives in the rural village R\u00e5skog in southern Sweden, received a great deal of attention when \"The Horseman's Last Stand\" documentary was released. Since then he has pursued a fierce battle with the authorities to keep his horses. A fight that has evolved into a question about justice and morality. How do we treat those who are perceived as different? Do the actions by the animal protection inspectors rely on their merits, or are there other, more personal, reasons for their interference? Meanwhile Stig-Anders continues to work on the farm, determined to fulfill his task according to the old traditions and fight for his right to keep horses like his forefathers always did.",
  "plot": "After the drug-induced death of his teenaged daughter, Christian (Peter Marshall) is sent a video tape, a \"snuff film\" involving his daughter and several men. Christian then decides to avenge his daughter by killing all those linked to the sex tape. Along the way he meets a teenage runaway named Alice (Caroline Marohasy) and a fragile friendship begins to unfold.",
