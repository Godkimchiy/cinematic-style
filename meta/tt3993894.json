  "overview": "Two women retreat to a lake house to get a break from the pressures of the outside world, only to realize how disconnected from each other they have become, allowing their suspicions to bleed into reality.",
  "storyline": "Two women go away together. One meets a man that distracts her from being there for her friend. The betrayed friend says, \"One day you will need me, and then I won't be there for you.\" When they next go away together the roles are reversed, the threat becomes reality. But the two situations are not exactly the same - the man in the first scenario was benign, the man in the second scenario is toxic. That and other differences displace the parallel between the two events.",
  "plot": "Catherine and Virginia, two women who grew up together, spend a week together at a lake house retreat, as they did the previous year. This time, however, Catherine's mood (and possibly her sanity) has been affected by the death of her father, as well as the ending of a relationship, and the women realize they have drifted apart.",
