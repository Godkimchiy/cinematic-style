  "overview": "In a secluded house in a small seaside town live four unrelated men and the woman who tends to the house and their needs. All former priests, they have been sent to this quiet exile to purge the sins of their pasts, the separation from their communities the worst form of punishment by the Church. They keep to a strict daily schedule devoid of all temptation and spontaneity, each moment a deliberate effort to atone for their wrongdoings.",
  "storyline": "Four Catholic Priests, now excommunicated, share a secluded house in a small coastal house of Chile, where they are are supposed to atone for their sins. Their quiet routine, placed under the supervision of Mother M\u00f3nica (Antonia Zegers), is disturbed by the coming of a fifth man. The newcomer, a pedophile, appears as a most unwelcome reminder of their own tainted lives.",
  "plot": "Four retired Catholic priests share a secluded house in the outskirts of a small Chilean beach town, under a vigilant female caretaker who used to be a nun. The four men are there to discreetly purge their sins and crimes (child abuse, baby-snatching for adoptions, whistleblower, etc.). They are not permitted to mingle with the townsfolk and are only allowed to be out during early morning and late night. Their only hobby is breeding a race dog and entering into competitions. This changes for them when a new priest arrives and a victim of his child abuse follows him. This results in the priest committing suicide. Subsequently a new spiritual director arrives and their life and their routine is disrupted.",
