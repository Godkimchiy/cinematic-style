  "storyline": "Suddenly, the successful forty-year-old architect, St\u00e9phanie, finds herself without a job after a botched business deal. As a result, caught between a rock and a hard place, the penniless and recently divorced single mother has no other choice but to move in with her widowed sexagenarian mother, Jacqueline, who, thankfully, welcomes her back with open arms. Now, as St\u00e9phanie starts looking for a new job, in the meantime, both women have to become accustomed to the current conditions to make things work out. However, Jacqueline has to make an important announcement. What are her secret plans for the future?",
