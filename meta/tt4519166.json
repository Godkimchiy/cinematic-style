  "storyline": "Imagine waking up tomorrow morning and all music has disappeared. Just like that. What will remain when it is all gone: Cd's, iPods, instruments? When we don't know anymore what it was: music? He shows it to us: Bill Drummond, the man who with The KLF once conquered the world of pop. An anarchic spirit, an eternal punk who now leads the largest choir of the world: The17, an ever changing ensemble of amateurs with no sheets of music and no rehearsals. Stefan Schwietert (Echoes of Home) accompanies Drummond as he finds new voices for his choir: in the open fields or in a factory, in a class room or in a pub. It is a journey to point zero of music. So we can innocently invent it again. Together, in this moment.",
