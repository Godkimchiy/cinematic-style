  "overview": "This fast-paced documentary captures the thrill of the annual running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. With red bandanas tied to their bodies, people scatter as the bulls make chase. Injuries are common, but the runners think it's worth the risk.",
  "storyline": "Every July in Pamplona, enormous fighting bulls charge through the cobbled streets of the town, surrounded by masses upon masses of thrill-seekers. With red bandanas tied to their bodies, the men and women scatter as the terrifying bulls make chase. Injuries are common - one man was trampled under the bulls' feet and broke his back in three places - but the runners think the glory is worth the risk. Alongside the reckless runners we see the animal rights protesters, the injured men, and the history of this extraordinary tradition. Some of these bull runners will never take part in the chase again - but not one of them will forget the experience.",
