  "overview": "The story of a town at the mercy of a landscape in transformation; standing on the brink of an encroaching reality, one in which the age-old fears of the inhabitants are being reproduced. A hamlet has survived, perched in a remote location where its children can grow up and the elderly can die and stay there.",
  "storyline": "Julian, an 8 year-old Raramuri boy, starts to glimpse the construction of strange tourist attractions in the Sierra Tarahumara mountain range. For Nazareno and other community elders these events confirm the threat of displacement that, for decades, has been hanging over their town, the most remote one, where, ignored by government officials, children grow up to live and the elders die to stay.",
