  "overview": "From 1977 to 1991 an image of Slovenia as a green, demilitarised and peaceful country of diligent people reigned in Yugoslavia, a country where differences are not only allowed, but also desired. This period ends with a ten-day war, when the identity turns from peacefulness, modesty and diligence into courage and a fighting spirit. The film documents the changes in Slovenia and its inhabitants, which have in recent years brought us to a completely different understanding of national identity, different from the one which was true in Slovenia as well as abroad twenty years ago.",
  "storyline": "The documentary tells the story of how in the 1980's Slovene identity was formed through marketing and pop culture in attempt of 'branding' the new state in an organized fashion as well as spontaneously, on the level of civil society.",
