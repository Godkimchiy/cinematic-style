  "storyline": "After the success of We're Nothing Like James Bond, its director Mario Balsamo turns to the themes of his autobiography, this time replacing the subject of friendship with that of family relations. So, what do a fifty-two-year-old son and an eighty-five-year-old mother make of an unresolved and conflictual relationship along with a mutual passion (cinema)? A film documentary. Especially if he is a director, she was an actress when she was young, and both have a yearning to appear on screen: with irony and surrealism, playing with reality and make-believe without avoiding the (universal) ties of a family relationship, where affection is hidden behind recriminations and much usurping. And all of this while the search is on for a film that the woman acted in sixty years ago, in fact: in which she had her most important role, but which, for inexplicable reasons, she has never wanted to see!",
