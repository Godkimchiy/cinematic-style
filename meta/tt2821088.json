  "overview": "Marco returns to Paris after his brother-in-law's suicide, where he targets the man his sister believes caused the tragedy - though he is ill-prepared for her secrets as they quickly muddy the waters.",
  "storyline": "Supertanker captain Marco Silvestri is called back urgently to Paris. His sister Sandra is desperate - her husband has committed suicide, the family business has gone under, her daughter is spiralling downwards. Sandra holds powerful businessman Edouard Laporte responsible. Marco moves into the building where Laporte has installed his mistress and her son. But he hasn't planned for Sandra's secrets, which muddy the waters...",
  "plot": "Marco (Vincent Lindon), a sailor who has cut off ties with most of his family, returns home after the suicide of his brother-in-law. At the urging of his sister Sandra (Julie Bataille), who believes that her husband\u2019s death was caused by one of their creditors, Marco tries to avenge his family. He moves in to an apartment above that occupied by the creditor, Edouard Laporte, and begins an affair with his wife, Rapha\u00eblle (Chiara Mastroianni). Marco discovers that his sister is deep in debt and that his niece, Justine (Lola Cr\u00e9ton), has been hospitalized and might need reconstructive surgery as her vagina has been badly damaged. After some investigation he believes that Laporte was the one who injured his niece by penetrating her with a corn cob.\n\nJustine eventually runs away from the hospital she was staying at and friends of hers offer Marco access to images of her going to a sex club with Laporte and her father. After viewing the images Marco realizes that both his sister and his brother-in-law allowed Laporte to use their daughter for sexual favours in return for money to keep their failing shoe factory afloat. Justine and her friends leave together but she deliberately crashes the car they are driving, killing them all.\n\nMeanwhile Laporte, discovering that Rapha\u00eblle and Marco are sleeping together, leaves her, taking their young son with him. When he returns to collect a few of his son\u2019s things and to tell Rapha\u00eblle that he is moving to Geneva with the boy, Marco tries to stop him. In the ensuing fight Marco is shot and killed by Rapha\u00eblle.\n\nSandra receives a video in the mail which she watches with Justine\u2019s doctor. It is a sex tape involving Justine, her father, Laporte and another woman. The tape shows Justine\u2019s father holding a corn cob.",
