Upon his retirement as the Chief Security Consultant in Las Vegas, Ken returned to his hometown Macau, where he met his old friend Benz, and Benz\u2019s son Cool and nephew Karl. Both Cool and Karl wanted to follow Ken. Ken claimed that if Cool could successfully cheat him once or win over him, he would then accept Cool as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Cool\u2019s step brother Lionel, an undercover agent, had disguised his identity in an international gambling mafia which had planned to form an alliance with mafias in illegal gambling from all over the world to control the result of soccer matches. Lionel had recorded the entire conference, with the criminal evidence kept in an imitated eye. The eye was coincidentally given to Rainbow, Ken\u2019s only daughter, which put her in danger. The retired Ken was forced to use his \u201cMagic Hand\u201d once again to uncover the evil plan\u2026",

However, his wife is suffering from cancer and knows nothing of their activities. Unbeknownst to all of them, Benz's stepson Lionel, a police officer, is on a deep undercover assignment as an employee of a multinational company called DOA. It is later revealed that DOA is merely the corporate front of a large criminal syndicate and is run by the ruthless Mr. Ko.

Ngau-Ngau becomes infatuated with Ken's daughter Rainbow and is determined to win her affection, even though Ken eventually makes it known that he prefers \"Cool\" to date his daughter and Rainbow repeatedly rebuffs Ngau-Ngau's efforts. Lionel realizes his cover has been blown and hides the contact lens in a stuffed teddy bear at home without his family's knowledge. Ngau-Ngau gives the bear to Rainbow when he and \"Cool\" visit Ken's house. Mr. Ko sends an assassin to Lionel's flat, only to find Benz, who has just returned home. Benz is beaten and tortured and ends up in a coma while Lionel's body is found later, also bearing torture marks.\n\nPolice detectives from China, Hong Kong and Macau decide to enlist the help of Ken to take down the wily and cunning Mr. Ko.

During the match he discovers that DOA's assassins have attacked his house and Rainbow, \"Cool\" and Ngau-Ngau are inside.\n\nRainbow is put inside a glass tank, which has gas in it.

Ken questions Cool who is more qualified to impart his skills to him. At this moment, the doors swing open. A man in his black suit, playing with his jade ring walks into the scene. \"I believe I am qualified to take him as my disciple.\" This man was no other than God of Gamblers Ko Chun (from the God of Gamblers series) himself.",
