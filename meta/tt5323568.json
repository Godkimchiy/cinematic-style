  "overview": "Louis Pothen (Mammootty) is an all rounder. He is divorce lawyer, he participates in live TV channel debates on various topics, and he is a film critic, too. His wife Vasuki Iyer (Nayantara) is a Kathakali artist, and together with his school-going daughter, they live in a city highrise. The story further focuses on an incident that sort of transformed the lively Vasuki into an introvert. What follows is a dramatic exploration of Vasuki's recent past and how she gets over it.",
  "storyline": "It's the story of how a housewife from a middle class family gets exploited by so called aliens of the malayalee society, low wage foreign workers, and how she gets her revenge. It also deals with crimes associated in general with these people.",
  "plot": "Louis Pothen is a television film critic, an artist, a divorce lawyer and also participates in a live TV channel named \"Kathrika\". His wife Vasuki Iyer is a Kathakali artist and they live together along with their school going daughter. They live away from their parents since their marriage was an inter-caste one.\n\nVasuki is raped by her two neighbors and their cloth presser. Vasuki is frightened to discuss with her husband about her being raped. Vasuki with DCP Jeena Bhai's telephonic assistance kills her rapists. Vasuki assures DCP that she would never have any contacts with her in the future and if they meet accidentally, would behave like strangers.\n\nIt is revealed that Louis was informed by Swami of his wife being raped. Swami had witnessed Vasuki being raped from his house but did not have the courage to save Vasuki since the rapists were notorious and drug addicts. Louis through a mobile software (which can transform a male voice to a female voice) mimicked DCP Jeena Bhai and guided Vasuki to murder her rapists . Louis never reveals the truth to Vasuki and decides to keep it as a secret so that they could lead a happy married life.",
