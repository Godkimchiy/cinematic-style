  "overview": "\u00abDestroy your ego\u00bb states writing on a wall left by a friend who died in tragic circumstances.  The sentence triggers a thought process in the author\u2019s mind, Cosimo Terlizzi, leading him  to delve deep into himself.  His thoughts are registered as in a spontaneous diary made of a couple\u2019s life, voyeurism,  constant geographical changes, multi media betrayals and book readings.  The collected traces take him to discover the lights and shadows of his personality. What  emerges is man\u2019s dual nature, divided between instinct and morality.",
