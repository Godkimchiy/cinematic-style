  "overview": "Alex Gray, Josh Mulcoy, and Pete Devries went on a journey through the remote Aleutian Arc of Alaska, the birthplace of storm systems that send swell back to the rest of us in civilization. They braved heavy weather, flew on rickety prop planes, and ate seal meat en route to discovering one of the best cold-water slabs in the world. The film follows the cold-water crew as they traverse the island on quad bikes, tracking pulses of swell to remote bays and never before surfed points. Set against the stunning volcanic backdrop of the Aleutian Islands, The Cradle of Storms is cold-water surf exploration at its finest.",
  "storyline": "Surfer Magazine presents The Cradle of Storms, a feature film. From Alaska to Russia, the Aleutian Islands extend through the most volatile waters in the North Pacific. Alex Gray, Josh Mulcoy, and Peter Devries head to the source in search of waves.",
