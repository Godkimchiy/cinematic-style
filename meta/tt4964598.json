  "storyline": "A hard-worker freelancer who falls in love with a doctor. While his life is getting worse every second. He must find the way to release his life to the beyond of everything.",
  "plot": "The film starts in Goa with the henchmen of Don Makrand Kamati (Vikramjeet Virk) kidnapping a girl at the beach and turning her into a slave for sale after injecting drugs into her. When police officer Madhusudhan (Devan) catches the slaves and drugs racket, Makarand and his henchman (Ajaz Khan) interfere him while speaking to the Media. They injure the honest Madhusudhan and turn him an immobile person. Thus their trade continues. The film then shifts to a time a year later where Varun (Nithiin) is shown roaming in the locales of Spain. Varun is a hippie kind of vagabond wandering all over the world. He lost his parents in his childhood when he was at America. Calling himself a free soul, he never believes in relationships and earns his living by working in part-time jobs he finds in Craigslist and rests at nights on the roads with some kitchen equipment to cook food. Now he is in Spain and there he comes across Hayathi (Adah Sharma), an Indian who arrived to Spain to meet her friend Priya (Kesha Khambati).\n\nIn order to capture her attention, Varun pretends to suffer with a Heart Attack and later takes her phone number but fails to know her name. Hayathi came to Spain to convince Priya's father ISKCON Ramana (Brahmanandam), a staunch Krishna devotee and person having hatred for Love and Lovers, to accept the Love marriage of Priya and Haridas (Hari Das), an African musician. After much chasing and teasing Varun asks Hayathi to give him a deep lip lock for which she denies and slaps him. Thus he keeps a stipulation that if Varun makes Ramana accept the marriage of the lovers, Hayathi has to kiss him. Varun wins the challenge and as per stipulation, Hayathi has to kiss him. On a separate note, Varun also exposes the drug racket of Makarand. After fighting with Makarand's men Ammu (Ajay) and others at the arena, he locks lips with Hayathi for a duration for more than an hour. But that lip lock too had a condition from Hayathi. When Varun asks for the condition, Hayathi levies a condition that Varun should never meet her at any cost as she is heartbroken since she was madly in love with Varun and he has no belief in relationships.\n\nVarun leaves to Romania where he meets a girl Chitrangada (Nicole Amy Madell) who also has a similar mindset. After spending some quality time with her, Varun realizes that he is indeed in love with Hayathi. After getting a strong moral support from Chitrangada, Varun desperately goes to Priya's home where he finds a slip in which it is written that Hayathi is in Goa. When he reaches Goa, with the help of a Rajinikanth fan (Ali), a mobile food selling trader, Varun tracks down Hayathi and when he meets her, he faces a strong rejection from Hayati that the time is up. Varun desperately tries to speak with her, but Makarand, Ammu and his men come and intervene saying that Hayathi is Makarand's would-be wife. Actually Hayati is Madhusudhan's daughter and in order to meet the expenses of her father's medication, Hayathi accepts marriage with Makarand without knowing the fact that Makarand was the reason for her father's hospitalization. After killing Ammu and talking with Makarand, Varun comes to know this and slaps Hayathi and asks the reason to part with him and hiding the facts. She replies that her problems would ruin Varun's happiness which he enjoys as a free soul.\n\nVarun is in need of 5 million rupees and he meets Prakash Raj (Prakash Raj), an influential person who offers Varun an amount of \u20b9 20&#160;million rupees and asks him to save his daughter who is kidnapped by Makarand as a part of his slave trade. Varun enters Makarand's den where he sees that Hayathi is also going to be a part of Makarand's trade and already drugs are injected into her body. While Varun is fighting with Makarand and his men, he is also injected with a drug injection and before losing consciousness, Varun slits Makarand's throat with a blade and kills him. Madhusudhan recovers from his injuries, Prakash Raj is happy with his daughter reaching him safely and the film ends with Varun and Hayathi reconciling and planning their Honeymoon after receiving flight trip tickets and money from Prakash Raj.",
