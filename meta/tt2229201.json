  "overview": "\"Influence\" is a story about the key events of the Wielkopolska Uprising - a dramatic arrival of Ignacy Jan Paderewski in Pozna\u0144, and the people who prepared the uprising, fought in it and won. \"Influence\" uses the characteristics of action and thriller movies. Refers to the cinema era - German expressionism, and the atmosphere of the era - the pervasive sense of the end of old world and the birth of the new one, fear of change and at the same time striving for it.",

The eerily whirring table becomes the center of an unfolding melodrama, giving birth to a love requiring the highest sacrifice of all.\n\u00a0\nAt once a pitch-black comedy of bourgeois manners, an alternative version of history and an unconventional spy thriller, ukasz Barczyks HISZPANKA (Influenz) creates a parallel world all its own. The movie merges fiction with historical fact, telling the true story of the only successful uprising in Polish history, which took place in Greater Poland in the years 1918-19. Visually ravishing, the film takes place in the digitally recreated city of Pozna at the turn of the 20th\u00a0century. The look of HISZPANKA is a nod to the works of German Expressionism, with the central figure of Dr Abuse being an obvious heir to Fritz Langs Dr Mabuse. Besides being a playful meditation on the nature of cinema itself, Influence provides a deep reflection of the eternal power struggle between reason and affect, order and chaos, as well as matter and spirit."
