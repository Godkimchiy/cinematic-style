He is head-over- heels in love with his neighbor Leena (Anjali), a bubbly mischievous girl. Now three separate gangs are out to kill Sakthi, due to his do-good nature which gets him into trouble. The three gangs baying for his blood are a hired killer Sampath who has personal animosity, Jayaprakash a jeweler who has a score to settle with him and his neighbor Jagan who finds him a hindrance in his nefarious activities.
