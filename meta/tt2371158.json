  "plot": "In 1995, during the insurgency in Kashmir, Hilaal Meer (Narendra Jha), a doctor, agrees to perform an appendectomy on the leader of a pro-separatist militant group. To avoid detection, he performs the surgery at his house, much to the chagrin of his wife Ghazala (Tabu), who questions his allegiance. The following day, during a military raid, Hilaal is accused of harbouring terrorists. A shootout ensues at his home, during which the leader of the separatist group is killed and Hilaal is taken away for questioning. The doctor's house is bombed subsequently to kill any other militant hiding inside. Several days later, Hilaal and Ghazala's son, Haider (Shahid Kapoor), returns from his Aligarh Muslim University to seek answers about his father's disappearance. Upon arrival, he is shocked to find his mother singing and laughing along with her brother-in-law, Khurram (Kay Kay Menon). Unable to understand his mother's behaviour, he begins searching for his father in various police stations and detention camps with the help of his childhood sweetheart Arshi (Shraddha Kapoor), a journalist.\n\nSaddened by the growing closeness between Ghazala and Khurram, and unable to find any leads, Haider begins to lose hope. However, Arshi encounters a stranger, Roohdar, who asks her to inform Haider that he will be able to provide information about Hilaal. Haider contacts Roohdar (Irrfan), who turns out to be part of a separatist group. Roohdar then narrates the story of how he met Hilaal in one of the detention centers, where they both were tortured. Hilaal attributes his imprisonment to his brother, Khurram. Roohdaar then tells the story of how Haider's father was brutally murdered by Khurram's made up terrorist group and how he survived after being shot and thrown into the river, which stopped his bleeding and allowed him to escape. Roohdaar then tells Haider that he simply wanted to pass on his father's message to him: revenge for Khurram's betrayal. Thereafter, angry and swearing to avenge the injustice done to his father, Haider breaks down at his father's gravesite and becomes mentally and emotionally shattered. He starts to suffer from the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder, shaving his head and behaving strangely. Khurram, after learning of the meeting between Haider and Roohdar, tells him that Roohdar was the one who killed his father. Haider is now confused as to whom to believe despite knowing the truth himself, and discloses his dilemma to Arshi, adding that Roohdar gave him a gun to kill his uncle. Arshi confides this to her father who informs Khurram about the gun. Khurram immediately orders his men to send Haider to a mental institution.\n\nThe following morning, Haider is all set to kill his uncle but cannot accomplish it because his uncle is offering prayers and his morals prevent it. Haider is captured by Arshia's father who orders him to be executed, but Haider manages to escape, although not before mercilessly killing his captors. He contacts Roohdar, who suggests getting trained in Pakistan to avenge his father's death, and Haider agrees. He calls his mother and informs her about it to which she asks him to meet her once before going to the other side of border. During the meeting, Ghazala discloses that she had told Khurram about the terrorists hiding in their house not knowing that he was an informer of the Indian army. Arshi's father traces them and is about to shoot Haider when Haider shoots him dead and escapes.\n\nTormented by her father's death at the hands of Haider, Arshia is emotionally traumatized and commits suicide. Meanwhile, Ghazala finds Roohdar's contact number from Arshia's diary and calls him. Haider goes to his pickup point, the graveyard where his father was buried. At the graveyard, Haider contemplates about the universal nature of mortality. On seeing Arshia's brother Liyaqat in the graveyard, he realises that the corpse is of Arshia. He runs towards her body where her brother sees him and informs Khurram. A fight ensues between Haider and Arshi's brother, resulting in the latter's death. Khurram arrives with full force and a gunfight ensues; meanwhile Roohdar drops Ghazala at the graveyard. A fierce exchange of bullets and bombs leaves only Haider and few men on Khurram's side alive. Just when Khurram is about to kill Haider, Ghazala pleads for a chance to convince Haider to surrender. She confronts her son who says that he cannot die before avenging his father's death. Ghazala tells him that revenge only results in revenge and there is no end to this cycle, but Haider, who is bent on revenge, does not understand. Ghazala kisses Haider goodbye and steps outside, only to reveal that she is wearing a suicide vest (given to her by Roohdar). Khurram and Haider rush towards her but she pulls the pins of the hand grenade resulting in a big explosion, killing herself along with the rest of Khurram's men and gravely injuring Khurram himself, while Haider is only slightly thrown back from the force of the explosion. Haider goes to his mother's remains, weeps by her side and goes to kill Khurram, whose legs have been severed from his body.\n\nHe is reminded of his mother's words that \"revenge only results in revenge\" and thus decides to let Khurram live. Khurram begs Haider to kill him to free him from the burden of guilt and to avenge his father's death, but Haider doesn't oblige Khurram, instead ignores him and leaves.",
  "synopsis": "The kids in the film are named Lambert (Joes Brauers), Tuur (Maas Bronkhuyzen), and Maartje (Pippa Allen). Lambert's family are cooperative with the German occupiers, which makes them unpopular with many of their fellow villagers, but makes it possible for Lambert's father to be installed as the village mayor. Lambert's elder brother has joined the Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth) and their father is trying to persuade Lambert to do the same. Lambert is not really interested in doing so, but his father gives him a model train set as enticement (he may have already had the train set, but it's not clear) and promises him a very nice locomotive for the set if he will do it.\nLambert's best friend Tuur doesn't seem to care if Lambert joins the Hitlerjugend or not, but he learns one night that his parents and elder brother are members of the local resistance network. His family does not know that he has become aware of their secret.\nBefore Tuur learns his family's secret, tomboy Maartje enters the picture. Maartje has moved to the village and is staying with her uncle's family. She isn't interested in befriending the girls in the village, and instead inserts herself into Lambert's and Tuur's friendship. Lambert welcomes Maartje, but Tuur isn't real crazy about having her around. Tuur begins to warm up to Maartje as she proves she isn't a girly-girl. One day when Lambert cannot join the other two, Maartje shares with Tuur that she is a Jew (which the audience has already been given clues to figure out) and she swears him to secrecy.\nKnowing that Maartje is a Jew whose real name is Tamar, and after learning that his family is in the resistance, and with Lambert's family collaborating with the Germans, Tuur begins avoiding Lambert. One Sunday after Tuur promises Lambert that they will hang out together, Tuur tells Lambert that he must help his little sister with her homework. Lambert goes to the farm where Maartje is staying and sees Tuur and Maartje playing with Maartje's pet pig, which was supposed to have been turned over to the Germans with all of the other pigs in the country to feed the German Army. Lambert tells his father that Maartje has a pig, and when the Germans go to confiscate the pig, they of course discover that Maartje is a Jew and they arrest her and her host family. Lambert has a club foot and a distinctive footprint, which Tuur saw in the mud outside Maartje's barn, so he realizes that Lambert was the one that betrayed Maartje. Tuur becomes enraged and assaults Lambert, and severs their friendship.\nUnder interrogation, Maartje's host family reveals that Tuur's family is part of the resistance, but Tuur's father finds out in time to get his family out of the house and into the countryside. Lambert gets food for Tuur's family to aid them in their successful attempt to cross the border into Belgium. Before leaving, Tuur and Lambert declare their friendship for each other again before parting ways."
