  "plot": "Nancy is 34 years old and single. Her sister hopes that Nancy can find love and encourages her to \"put herself out there.\" Nancy has a failed blind date at her friend's engagement party.\n\nLater, Nancy's parents are celebrating their 40th anniversary, so Nancy takes the train to London. On the train, Nancy sits across from Jessica, a 24-year-old woman who is going on a blind date based on a self-help book called 6 Billion People and You. Nancy is rude to Jessica, so Jessica leaves her copy of the book with Nancy, bookmarking Chapter 7, \"Your Negative Thoughts are Ruining Your Life (And Everyone Else's...)\". When disembarking the train, Nancy pursues Jessica to return the book, but is stopped by Jack, Jessica's blind date. Nancy decides to take a chance and pretend that she is Jessica, and the pair have a very good time drinking and bowling, but Nancy's ruse is destroyed when they run into Nancy's creepy middle school acquaintance, Sean.\n\nNancy and Jack argue and return to the bar, where they run into Jack's soon-to-be-ex-wife with the man she is having an affair with. Nancy has to console Jack in the bathroom and helps him achieve closure.\n\nNancy wants to invite Jack to her parents' anniversary party -- but Jessica has left telephone messages for Jack and still wants to meet up, so he parts ways with Nancy. Nancy arrives at her parent's party, but is very sad and Jack also quickly realizes that letting her go was a mistake. He enlists the help of Sean and some teenagers to find Nancy's house and they decide to take a chance on each other.",
