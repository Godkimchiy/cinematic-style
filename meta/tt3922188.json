  "storyline": "\u00c1lvaro Recoba and Antonio Pacheco are captains and referents of Nacional and Pe\u00f1arol, respectively. These rivals on the soccer field and friends in life became co-directors, along with Rafael Perrone (father-in-law of Recoba), of a group of the Montevidean carnival. They live a passion in common and show us how family and friendship are above their love of football and the colors they have worn. Patented players tell the lives of these two idols by drawing a parallel between the worlds of football and the carnival, the two passions of the Uruguayan people.",
