  "overview": "Marina, an upper-crust social worker with a doting husband and an enviable downtown apartment, is suddenly transformed into a bizarre twilight version of herself when she is raped by three policemen.",
  "storyline": "Marina is an attractive upper-class woman with an opulent wardrobe and a good-looking husband. She's employed as a social worker, a profession offering meager financial rewards. Thankfully her affluent father provides the supplementary income which her job as well as hapless husband cannot. Yet instead of finding contentment in her win-win situation, Marina carries on an affair with her best friend's husband, and also initiates a bizarre series of erotic encounters with a deadbeat cop who previously raped her.",
