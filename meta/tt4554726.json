  "overview": "Stay inside all the time? Never take your shoes off? Feel fatigued? You could have Natural Deficit Disorder. Learn how the earth can help neutralize the disease-causing radicals in the body, by doing something as simple as swimming or walking barefoot.",
  "storyline": "If you are an Earthling, this film has an important and uplifting message for YOU. Featuring Apollo Astronaut, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, Canadian Broadcaster, Dr. David Suzuki, Internet Health Guru, Dr. Joseph Mercola, the film informs us about the little-known fact that the Earth's surface emits a constant stream of electrons, which neutralize the disease-causing free radicals in our bodies, which cause painful, chronic, inflammatory conditions. Clinical trials at the University of Florida at Gainesville have shown that such chronic inflammation can be improved or reversed in 95% of all cases by the regular practice of Grounding and/or of using Grounding resources.",
  "plot": "A man named Viktor Kahdem has almost given up on life because he has been sentenced to a low-security prison farm with a non-threatening environment where it still seems like some individuals can be reformed. At Won Wron, a case worker named Matt Perry has established a special kind of program to rehabilitate broken men by giving them the responsibility for rehabilitating injured raptors. Against all odds, Viktor meets Matt and becomes his number one test case and is introduced to Yasmine, the majestic wedge tailed eagle with a 2-metre wingspan. If these two can tame each other, anything is possible.",
