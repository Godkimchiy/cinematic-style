  "plot": "A few months before Mia (Julia Montes) turns 18, her father (Jett Pangan) dies. She goes to Baguio City to live with her mother (Ina Raymundo), her stepfather (Edu Manzano), and her half-brother (Miguel Vergara). Mia misses her father terribly that she finds it hard to fit into her new home, despite her mother\u2019s sympathetic efforts and her half-brother\u2019s irresistible cuteness. Good thing, Mia seems to be friendly enough to have made new pals, like Alvin Paredes (JC de Vera), who, it turns out, sees her as more than a friend.\n\nThen Mia meets a mysterious young man who suddenly appears and disappears; and he\u2019s always dressed in black leather jacket over white shirt, scarf, and denim pants whom she gets to know as Gio Brauner (Gerald Anderson). Mia is smitten by Gio\u2019s romantic gestures and protective ways. He teaches her to play the guitar, and brings her roses, and he even rescues her from bad guys, and helps her overcome her fears. She feels she has found in Gio her knight in shining armor who will rescue her from her incurable loneliness and deathly sadness.\n\nBut Mia\u2019s family and friends are alarmed that she has become secluded and deluded in her own imaginary world. In the end, she has to decide what matters most to her and where her heart truly is.",
