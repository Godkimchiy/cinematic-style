  "plot": "The film follows history professor Dr. Ben Rhodes who has confrontational relationship with his new boss Dr. Valerian Hadley played by William Sadler. Hadley is also the faculty adviser for Anna Densmore played by Jillian Taylor and who develops a problematic sexual relationship with Rhodes. However, Rhodes also has a supposedly non-romantic sexual relationship with Stacey Castillo played by Leticia Jimenez. All the relationships come to a dramatic confrontation in the end which includes a sexual assault which Cynthia Kirkeby of the Point Of View Reviews describes as likely to \"polarize many discussions around the script.\"",
