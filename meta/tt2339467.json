  "storyline": "Most people who visit India snap a few pictures of themselves in front of the Taj Mahal, do some yoga, and call it a good trip. Josh Thomas and J.J. Kelley, the comic pair of Dudes on Media and the makers of the Emmy Nominated documentary Paddle to Seattle tour the subcontinent a little differently, though. A cultural expedition: two seasoned adventurers take the cumulative skills learned over years of Alaska wilderness travel and apply it to a dramatically different natural wonder: the River Ganges, population 400 million. Living and traveling like the locals, they experience this river like it's never been done before.",
