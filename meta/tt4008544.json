  "overview": "THE BRIGHT DAY weaves a story that has its roots in the complexity of Iran\u2019s draconian laws governing capital punishment. A kindergarten teacher hopes to aid the father of one of her young students, a man accused of manslaughter, by convincing each of seven reluctant witnesses to come forward. No one lacks a hidden agenda in this drama in which shades of truth collide with self-interest and the specter of payback. (Gene Siskel Film Center)",
  "storyline": "Kindergarten teacher Roshan finds herself in a quandary when she embarks on a quest to save the life of her student's father, who has been accused of unintentional homicide and faces the death penalty. There are witnesses to support him, however it soon becomes clear that they are afraid to comply because of the victim's powerful family's influence, and they are terrified of repercussions in their own lives. Roshan doggedly sticks to her goal in this tale of one woman against a corrupt judicial system. Winner of the Crystal Phoenix at the 31st Fajr Film Festival, this drama is not to be missed.",
