His mutinous Chinese crew suspect him and his unscrupulous Boss of planning to scuttle the ship for an insurance scam.

Dawn comes a few hours later and so does a search party, looking for a murderer..... (In English & Mandarin.) Inspired by Joseph Conrad's \"The Secret Sharer\"",
  "plot": "In the present day Gulf of Thailand, novice sea captain Konrad (Jack Laskey) tries to master a Chinese cargo ship and its resentful crew, who suspect he has orders from his boss to scuttle the vessel as part of an insurance scam.\n\nThe crew abandons ship, and later Konrad finds a naked body clinging to the ship\u2019s rope ladder. Pulling on the ladder, he finds a young Chinese woman named Li (Zhu Zhu), exhausted from swimming across from the only other ship anchored in the bay. She whispers \"Hide me\", and he agrees to give her shelter.\n\nThe next morning a search party arrives from the other ship, along with Konrad\u2019s crew, looking for a woman they claim to be a murderer.\n\nKonrad takes a risk and does not give Li up. Over the remainder of the journey, he shares his food, thoughts, clothes and cabin with his stowaway, keeping her presence on board the ship a secret from his crew, who would use any excuse to strip him of his captaincy. Konrad sets a course that avoids Chinese territorial waters and puzzles over how to help Li escape to freedom and start a new life.\n\nAs the journey progresses and romance grows within the captain\u2019s cabin, Konrad begins to win the respect of his crew under Li\u2019s guidance. Updated orders come from the ship\u2019s owner instructing Konrad to scuttle the ship before an upcoming storm, and promising a large bonus for doing so. Konrad, however, begins to question his mission.",
