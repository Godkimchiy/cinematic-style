  "storyline": "Francis, a 22-year-old, does not have the arms from birth; the rest of his body is 'normal', in fact, he's quite beautiful and well-formed. Life has taught him to use his legs as unique arts and his feet are his very special and skilful hands. He is a very good university student and he has a real close friend, Stefano. He lives alone with his mother, Grazia, a famous architect from Bari. Francesco, however, unlike the dear friend, has never yet experienced the joys of love, and this, now at over twenty years, has become a problem.",
