  "overview": "In a remote house in Maine, two friends predict shifts in global financial markets by viewing footage of the forest.",
  "storyline": "A digital-pastoral drama of friendship, landscape and technology, \"For the Plasma\" begins as the story of two young women (Anabelle LeMieux and Rosalie Lowe) employed as forest-fire lookouts in Northern Maine, and ends in a hundred places at once. Along the way, the girls make financial predictions based on surveillance footage of the surrounding forest, the local lighthouse keeper and a pair of unusual investors interrupt their solitude, and a dreamlike portrait of small town America and contemporary life is revealed. \"For the Plasma\" is a film of minimal means but ambition, shot in Super 16mm and 4:3 with a small cast and crew, and scored by the great Japanese experimental composer, Keiichi Suzuki.",
