  "plot": "Yu Wei and Shin Min lose their mates in the same multi-car pile-up. Yu Wei tries to fill up the sorrowful emptiness in his heart with alcohol and to him, temporary orgasm is mere morphine, which avails him nothing. Shin Min cooks the recipes her fianc\u00e9 had left day after day. The honeymoon to Okinawa that they will never have the chance to go on together is but endless tears. That day, on a bus driving on a winding mountain road, the setting sun shone upon their faces occasionally. They silently exchanged a glance, as if they could see their reflection in each other. They are the most familiar strangers.",
