  "overview": "Two high school filmmakers decide to create the illusion of a haunting on an unsuspecting neighbor.",
  "storyline": "Harbouring negative feelings of their cantankerous neighbour and cryptic hermit, Harold Grainey, the bored tech-savvy best friends, Ethan and Sean, decide to play a trick on him, under the guise of a psychological social experiment. Thrilled with the idea of becoming the next YouTube sensation, the boys embark on an audacious project to convince the man that his dark and vacant house is haunted and record his unmodified reaction with their advanced computer setup. Now, the stage seems set for the ultimate \"Haunting Project\". However, who is truly the good neighbour living across the street?",
  "plot": "Ethan (Miller) and Sean (Gilchrist) are tech-savvy high-school teenagers who decide to prank their neighbor, Harold Grainey (Caan), by convincing him that his house is haunted. When Grainey leaves home one afternoon, the two set up equipment to simulate the haunting, as well as hidden cameras which will broadcast Grainey's reactions.\n\nAs the basis for a school project, Ethan requests Sean's assistance in setting up hidden cameras at Grainy's home so both can view a person's unfiltered reaction to being haunted by a poltergeist, despite Sean's initial reservations. The cameras are set up so that both can monitor Grainey's reactions for 6 weeks live from computers in Ethan's bedroom. Grainey has a reputation for being hostile, a recluse, and a \"creepy old man\" in the neighbourhood, which makes it easier for Ethan to justify choosing him as his subject.\n\nEthan starts to initiate activities aimed at unsettling Grainey, to make him believe the house is haunted, including making the kitchen door bang loudly in the middle of the night, disabling the heating system (which causes the bedroom window to shatter because of the freezing temperature), and activating the music player in the middle of the night.\n\nBut both Sean and Ethan are mystified by Grainey's ability to withstand all these strange occurrences. In one instance, they observe Grainey being disturbed by all the strange noises and then going down to the house's basement. The duo are not able to observe what he does, as they were not able to set up a camera there. Grainey goes down at about 11:30 p.m. and only emerges after 7:30 a.m. This leaves Ethan perplexed, and he vows to determine the reason.\n\nThroughout the movie, we are shown flashbacks of Grainey and his wife. These flashbacks are all linked with the \"paranormal\" activities that the boys try to use to unsettle Grainey. For example, a flashback shows Grainey's wife dancing to music at 3am and crying and one of the activities the boys do is play the same music at a similar time. Another example is how Grainey's wife used to complain about the door not shutting correctly and banging. The first activity the boys did was slam the door continuously, leading to Grainey destroying it with an axe.\n\nIn the meantime, Ethan throws a Halloween party, and Sean and his new girlfriend decide to make out in a spare bedroom. His girlfriend notices a camera installed on top of the bed, which leaves Sean enraged. In an argument with Ethan, Sean discloses to Ethan that he knows the true reason why Ethan has targeted Grainey: Grainey was responsible for sending Ethan's father to jail many years ago. Ethan's father was an alcoholic who beat his wife regularly. During one such episode, Ethan's mother ran up to Grainey seeking his help. Grainey informed the police which led to Ethan's father being jailed and ultimately getting divorced from his wife. Ethan believes Grainey is responsible for destroying his family and making him lose his father.\n\nSean asks Ethan to return all his equipment, but Ethan refuses, threatening Sean with the fact that the equipment was purchased using his credit card and that it is covered in Sean's fingerprints. In the middle of their argument, they observe Grainey's cat toppling over one of the living room cameras. Ethan runs to his home to collect the camera, and in doing so finds the basement door unlocked. He goes down to find that Grainey has been hiding his deceased wife's used medical supplies all along as a way for him to remember her. It is then revealed in a series of flashbacks that Grainey loved his wife dearly, and he had set up a room where he could take care of her, including arranging a nurse. The viewer then realises that every activity performed by the boys related to Grainey's wife somehow and Grainey is convinced that he is being haunted by his wife. Earlier in the movie, a police officer goes to his house claiming someone made a complaint about a woman screaming from the basement, when in actuality it was Ethan and Sean. Ethan lifts a bell which Grainey gifted, causing the bell to make a sound which awakes Grainey. Fearing for his safety, Ethan hides in the living room, placing the bell on a table. Grainey sees the bell, and a flashback is shown when Grainey first gifts the bell saying that whenever she needed him, she only had to ring the bell. Grainey took the bell noise that awoke him and the fact that the bell was on the table led Grainey to believe it was as a sign that his wife wants him to be with her, and so he kills himself with his gun.\n\nEthan and Sean are arrested and sentenced to 2 years' probation and 500 hours community service. Leaving the courthouse, Ethan is surrounded by a slew of reporters and cameras. Having finally gained the attention he admitted to craving in an earlier scene, a slight smile appears on his face. Sean looks horrified as he realizes the ordeal may have sent his friend down a dark path.",
  "synopsis": "Ethan is a tech-savvy high school teenager who lives with his mom across the road from Harold, a grumpy, dislikeable old man who lives on his own, is rude to everybody and does all he can to keep himself to himself. Harold doesn't answer the door to a friend who calls by and threatens to dismember another neighbor's dog when it comes on to Harold's property.Ethan and his friend Sean have a school project and decide it would be amusing to make Harold believe his house is haunted and monitor his reaction. They know that Harold goes out on a regular shopping trip and never locks his doors, so they purchase some hidden cameras and other electronic gadgetry with Sean's dad's credit card and go to Harold's house while he is out. They set up cameras in different rooms and rig various household appliances so that they can control them remotely. While they are in the house they notice that Harold keeps his cellar door padlocked. This seems odd, given that Harold never locks his outside doors.The experiments are a success: the boys use a computer in Ethan's bedroom to observe Harold's behavior while making his lights flicker, his screen door bang open and shut and his music player turn on and off. However they are puzzled that Harold doesn't react or appear frightened. Instead, we see him experiencing flashbacks where his wife appears, telling him to fix the screen door (which he eventually does by destroying it with an ax), or asking him if he wants to dance to the music with her. The flickering lights trigger a security alarm which causes police officer Palmer to call by, but Harold rudely sends him away. The boys are also mystified to observe Harold disappearing into his cellar whenever these ghostly events occur; on one occasion staying there all night and emerging only early the next morning. He has also stopped going out of the house.Convinced that Harold is hiding something in his cellar, the boys call the police anonymously, claiming to have heard a woman's screams coming from his house. Officer Palmer comes to investigate again but leaves without fuss after Harold allows him to search the cellar. Ethan, who has been secretly watching all of this, is certain Officer Palmer missed something and pushes hard for the boys to search the cellar themselves, but Sean refuses and asks why Ethan is so obsessed. It transpires that Ethan didn't just target Harold because he was a mean old man; he also holds Harold responsible for putting Ethan's father in jail. Ethan's father was a violent alcoholic who frequently attacked his mother. During one of these attacks his mother ran to Harold for help and Harold called the police.Ethan and Sean's relationship deteriorates badly after a party at Ethan's house, where Sean goes into a bedroom to make out with a girlfriend when she discovers a hidden camera and they realize that Ethan is watching them. Sean is furious, declares he want nothing more to do with the experiment and demands the return of all his equipment, but Ethan refuses and threatens Sean with the fact that it is all traceable back to him and his dad's credit card. Their argument is interrupted when Harold's cat knocks over one of the hidden cameras while Harold is asleep in his bedroom and Ethan has to go and recover it before it's discovered. This he does without incident while Sean monitors the cameras to warn him if Harold wakes up. However on his way back out of the house Ethan notices that the cellar door is unlocked. He is overcome with curiosity and goes down into the cellar where he discovers that Harold has made a shrine to his dead wife there. Ethan picks up a hand bell which makes a noise, waking Harold up which Sean observes and warns Ethan by text. Ethan just has time to go back silently upstairs, lock the cellar door, put the bell (which he inadvertently carried up with him) down on the living room table and hide underneath a table before Harold emerges from his bedroom to investigate. Harold notices the bell, goes back into his bedroom and comes out again carrying a handgun. Ethan cowers under the table expecting to be discovered, but to the boys' shock Harold turns the gun instead and shoots himself in the head. Sean rushes over so they can remove all evidence of their surveillance before the police arrive, but Officer Palmer is in the neighborhood, hears the shot and arrives immediately to arrest both boys on the spot.A final flashback reveals the reason for Harold's behavior. It turns out that Harold was a sad and lonely old man who was deeply in love with his wife. When she fell ill and lay dying, Harold bought her the hand bell and made a solemn promise that whenever she rang it, he would come to her. All this time he believed that his wife was causing the paranormal events and when he heard the bell ring and saw it on the living room table he was convinced that it was she, calling him to join her.At the resultant criminal trial (for which we saw flash forwards throughout the movie) the boys are given a probationary sentence and a community service order. Afterwards as they leave the courthouse Sean heads off to join his friends and family leaving Ethan on his own. As Ethan stands there, surrounded by a crowd of reporters and photographers all giving him their full attention, a small smile starts to appear on his face."
