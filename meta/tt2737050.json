  "overview": "Sandra is a young woman who has only one weekend to convince her colleagues they must give up their bonuses in order for her to keep her job \u2014 not an easy task in this economy.",
  "storyline": "Sandra Bya, married with two children, has been off work from her job at Solwal on medical leave for depression. During her absence from work, her boss, M. Dumont, on the suggestion of her immediate supervisor, the shop foreman Jean-Marc, figures that her section of the company can function with sixteen people working full time with a bit of overtime instead of seventeen with no overtime, that seventeenth person being Sandra. Because of the global competition the company faces, Dumont decides the company can only finance the annual bonuses for those sixteen employees, which are EUR1,000 per person, or Sandra's job, leaving the decision to those sixteen. On a Friday near the end of her medical leave, Sandra learns of this situation from her friend and co-worker Juliette after the \"show of hands\" vote is held, the result a 13-3 decision for the bonuses over Sandra's job. Because Juliette knows Jean-Marc, who is determined to get rid of Sandra, influenced the vote by scare mongering ...",
  "plot": "In Seraing, an industrial town near Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, Sandra is a young wife and mother, who works in a small solar-panel factory. She suffers a nervous breakdown and is forced to take time off from her job. During her absence, her colleagues realize they are able to cover her shifts by working slightly longer hours and the management proposes a \u20ac1,000 bonus to all staff if they agree to make Sandra redundant. Sandra later returns to work and discovers that her fate rests in the hands of her sixteen co-workers, and she must visit each of them over the course of a weekend to persuade them to reject the monetary bonus. However, most of the co-workers need the proposed bonus for their own families and Sandra faces an uphill battle to keep her job before the crucial vote on Monday morning.\n\nIn the final scene, the factory workers have a second ballot, in which eight vote for her to keep the job, and eight vote to keep the bonus. As a result, Sandra will not keep her position.\n\nHowever, the manager of the factory calls her into his office, and agrees to give her the job of one of the others, a contract worker who voted in her favor. She turns it down \u2013 she now has the confidence to start anew, and pursue a new life for herself.",
