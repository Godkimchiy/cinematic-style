  "overview": "It's no surprise when Karo is fired. She is loud, over-emotional and egocentric, more so than the average Berliner wise-ass, says her best friend Anna. Karo is not one to give up easily, though: she opts for radical change and goes into therapy. Although her therapist advises her to keep calm, Karo throws herself into it.",
  "storyline": "Twenty-two-year-old Karo (Claudia Eisinger) decides that it is high time for a therapy. The emotional and sometimes selfish young woman has lost her beloved job, stressing with her mother Luzy (Katja Riemann) and is generally in a pretty deep hole. As she deals with the question of what to do with her life now, she overcomes the sheer fear. Her therapist Anette (Maren Kroymann) advises to rest, but this is something with which she absolutely can not serve. Instead, she soon returns to full throttle, because there is a lot that needs to be fixed. Precisely because she now tries to do everything right, to set the course again in a rush, she does everything wrong - and her friend Philipp (Christoph Letkowski) with her conclusion. This is followed by panic attacks and a little later a real depression .",
