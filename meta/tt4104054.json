  "storyline": "The Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard platoon deal with a visiting female journalist and a German spy as World War II draws to its conclusion.",
  "plot": "It is the summer of 1944 and the Invasion of Normandy is coming soon. In Walmington-on-Sea, Captain Mainwaring's Home Guard is suffering from a lack of luck and appreciation, as well as feeling useless. This is until an elegant journalist, Rose Winters arrives to cover a report on the platoon's motives and activities. All the men are charmed by her presence, especially Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson, causing a feud with the townsfolk, especially the platoon's wives. Meanwhile, MI5 have detected a radio signal transmitted from Walmington towards Berlin, believed to be the work of a Nazi spy. MI5's Major Cunningham and Captain Meeks locate Captain Mainwaring and inform him of the enemy presence, stating that \"it could be anyone\". This news gives the Home Guard a chance to make a real difference in the war. The troop begin to search for the spy, until Rose informs them that it is Sergeant Wilson.\n\nCaptain Mainwaring believes Rose and arrests Wilson. Meanwhile, Private Godfrey's sisters speculate from their investigative evidence that Rose is the foreign agent among them. Winters records the information that the base set at Dover is a dummy one for German aircraft. The platoon and their wives rally to stop Winters and they engage in dangerous cross-fire with a German U-boat and a bunch of Wehrmacht soldiers who are helping Winters escape. The U-boat flees without Winters boarding. Mainwaring arrests Winters and hands her over to MI5. The troop then parade through Walmington, having fought off the Nazis, and are congratulated by Colonel Theakes. Mainwaring and Wilson reconcile. Theakes congratulates the platoon further by telling them that they have played a prominent part in the war effort.",
