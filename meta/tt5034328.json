  "overview": "Five people of Indian origin are killed in Kuala Lumpur within a short span of time. At first there is some doubt that these attacks are racially motivated. But the investigating officer Anwar Ali (Sarath Kumar), a Tamilian of Indian origin, feels that there is no ground to believe that.  As he and his team investigate the Facebook profiles of the victims, they find a common factor - all had a mutual friend with the profile name \u2018Asha Black\u2019.  Parallel to the investigation, an online romance blooms between \u2018Asha Black\u2019 and Coimbatore based young musician Rohith (Arjun Lal).  Asha (newcomer Ishitha) is a 17-year-old girl addicted to making online friends and chatting with them 24/7. Rohith falls in love with her and decides to go to Kuala Lumpur and meet her on her eighteenth birthday.",
