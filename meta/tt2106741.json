  "overview": "One rainy night in an arms factory near Shanghai, a young female worker accused of stealing a box of bullets from the ruthless Boss Ding (Liu Kai Chi) is violently killed in a game of Russian roulette. Half a month later, a series of inexplicable deaths takes place in the factory, where the victims are shot but no bullets are found. Rumors of a deadly curse begin to spread in the factory, terrorizing the workers there. So, eccentric police inspector Song Donglu (Lau Ching Wan) and his hot-blooded, gunslinging partner Guo Zhui (Nicholas Tse) are sent in to investigate the mystery of the phantom bullets...",
  "storyline": "Son Donglu, a newly promoted detective teams up with Guo Zhui, fastest gunman in Tiancheng and Xiaowu, a novice policeman to investigate the mystery deaths in a bullet factory.",
  "plot": "Ding (Liu Kai-chi), the overbearing owner of a bullet factory in Tiancheng County, intimidates his workers to keep them in line, leading to a public Russian roulette \"suicide\" of a female employee (Xuxu) accused of stealing a box of bullets. A curse relating to a certain \"Phantom Bullet\" is found written in red on the walls of the factory, though the workers are soon ordered to scrub it off. Subsequent deaths from \"phantom bullets\" which are never found, seemingly vanishing, suggest that the factory has really been cursed. Song Donglu (Lau Ching-wan), a newly promoted detective with a slightly eccentric personality, is summoned by Tiancheng's police chief Jin (Wu Gang) to assist Guo Zhui (Nicholas Tse), \"the fastest gunman in Tiancheng\", and novice policeman Xiaowu (Boran Jing) in investigating the peculiar murders.",
