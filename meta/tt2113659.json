  "storyline": "\"Elsa and Fred\" is the story of two people who at the end of the road, discover that it's never too late to love and make dreams come true. Elsa has lived for the past 60 years dreaming of a moment that Fellini had already envisaged: the scene in 'La Dolce Vita' at the Fontana di Trevi. The same scene without Anita Ekberg in it, but with Elsa instead. Without Marcello Mastroianni but with that love that took so long to arrive. Fred has always been a good man who did everything he was supposed to do. After losing his wife, he feels disturbed and confused and his daughter decides that it would be best if he moves into a smaller apartment where he ends meeting Elsa. From that moment on, everything changes. Elsa bursts into his life like a whirlwind, determined to teach him that the time he has left to live -- be it more or less -- is precious and that he should enjoy it as he pleases. Fred surrenders to Elsa's frenzy, to her youth, to her boldness, to her beautiful madness. And this is ...",
  "plot": "The recently widowed, 80-year-old Fred Barcroft is moved against his will, by his daughter, into an apartment in New Orleans, next door to 74-year-old Elsa Hayes. Fred has become an embittered, inactive realist who spends most of his time lying down; Elsa is a flighty, vivacious romanticist who dreams of \"the sweet life in Rome,\" as experienced by Anita Ekberg in the 1961 film La Dolce Vita. Despite their opposite temperaments and outlooks on life, they fall in love.\n\nElsa coaxes Fred out of his shell but tries his patience by telling him several lies about herself. She claims to be a widow and hides her severe kidney disease which requires dialysis. He doesn't know whether or not to believe her claim that Pablo Picasso did a painting of her, which she has in a safe to which she has misplaced the key.\n\nWhen he finds from his doctor friend John that she is probably dying, he takes Elsa to Rome to fulfill her dream of wading (like Ekberg) in the Trevi Fountain, rather than investing in his son-in-law's dubious business venture. After she dies, her son opens the safe and gives Fred Picasso's painting, which she wanted him to have.",
