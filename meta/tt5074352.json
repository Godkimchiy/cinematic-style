  "plot": "Mahavir Singh Phogat is an amateur wrestler who was forced to give up wrestling in order to obtain gainful employment. He was unable to win a gold medal for India and vows that his son will. He is disappointed when his wife gives birth to four daughters. He gives up his dream thinking that girls cannot wrestle and should only be taught household chores. But when his older daughters, Geeta and Babita, come home after beating up two boys in response to derogatory comments, Mahavir realises his daughters have the potential to become wrestlers.\n\nMahavir begins coaching Geeta and Babita in wrestling. His methods seem harsh, including grueling early morning workouts and short haircuts to avoid lice. Initially, the girls resent their father for his treatment but they soon realise that their father wants them to have a future and not grow up to be stereotypical housewives. The girls become motivated and willingly participate in Mahavir's coaching. Mahavir takes the girls to wrestling tournaments. Geeta and Babita both wrestle with boys and beat them, much to everyone's dismay. Geeta eventually wins the Junior Nationals and goes to an institute in Patiala for further training so that she can participate in the Commonwealth Games.\n\nGeeta makes friends at the institute and begins to disregard the discipline she has been brought up with. She regularly watches TV, eats street food, and grows her hair longer. Her coach's training differs significantly from her father's techniques. Geeta believes her coach's techniques are better and that Mahavir's techniques are outdated. On a visit home, she is determined to show her father she can wrestle well without his techniques. This leads to a ferocious bout between Geeta and Mahavir. Mahavir loses against Geeta due to his age. Babita tells Geeta that she shouldn't forget her father's techniques and reminds her that it is because of their father that she is where she is now.\n\nBabita soon follows Geeta to the institute. Geeta finds herself losing every match as she is not following her father's techniques or she is not fully focused on wrestling (painting her nails and growing her hair long). Realising her error, she tearfully makes peace with Mahavir. Mahavir comes to Patiala and begins coaching Geeta and Babita secretly, using the same methods as when they were younger. Their coach comes to know about this and is furious with Mahavir's interference and wants to expel them both from the institution, but a deal is struck to allow them to continue as long as Mahavir does not enter the institution or train them elsewhere. Determined to continue assisting his daughters, Mahavir obtains tapes of Geeta's previous unsuccessful bouts and coaches her by pointing out her errors over the phone.\n\nDuring Geeta's bouts in the Commonwealth Games, Mahavir constantly contradicts her coach's instructions while sitting in the audience. Geeta disregards her coach and follows her father's instructions and wins every bout. Just before the final bout, Geeta's jealous coach conspires to lock Mahavir in a closet far away from the arena. Due to her father's absence, Geeta starts lagging behind in the bout where she manages to win the first round but loses the second. It's the final round and the score is 4-1 where Geeta is down.In the last handful of seconds Geeta becomes desperate to win some points but in return loses another. Now, the score is 5-1. Only a quarter of the final minute is left, and now, Geeta starts recalling her father's teachings. She recalls her father talking about a 5 pointer suplex back when she was young. Mahavir said that the suplex is difficult but can be applied. She also recalls her father saying that one has to play with the opponent's mind. Mahavir said that one has to show something and do something else. Combining these two teachings, Geeta gives her opponent a suplex in the final 3 seconds, leading to a score of 6-5 (Geeta being up) and becomes the first Indian female wrestler to win gold. Mahavir returns just in time to embrace his daughters, frustrating the coach's hopes of obtaining credit before the news media.\n\nThe end credits reveal that Babita also won a silver medal in wrestling at the Commonwealth Games in 2014, Geeta became the first Indian female wrestler to qualify for the Olympics and Mahavir's efforts inspired dozens of Indian women to participate in wrestling.",

After 13-14 years, one day a neighbor family having two son age 13-14 years comes at Mahavir's house to complain about their sons being beaten up by Geeta and Babita. Mahavir asks them how Geeta and Babita beat the two boys and the girls happily demonstrate on their cousin Omkar. Mahavir's eyes sparkle by that his daughters have a wrestler's blood and he tells his wife that a Gold medal is ultimately a Gold medal and it does not matter whether a boy wins it or a girl and that he has decided that both Geeta and Babita will now not touch any cooking utensil or do any household work but they will now become a wrestler and will win Gold medal for the country.Mahavir starts their training by being very tough coach, waking them up 5 A.M. everyday . He maintains their diet and restricts any street-food, spicy food of such and make them exercise. When Geeta and Babita complains about how their hair are ruined due to training in dirt - he calls a barber and cut their hairs off. And when he sees that they both are weak - he makes them non-vegetarian. Both sisters are very angry on Mahavir since he is being very cruel by making two girl child training as a wrestler. So they start doing little tricks to him by changing the alarm and eating spicy food whenever they can and not wrestling properly. But one day when they both attend a wedding of their 14-year old girl-friend named Sunita (child-marriage) and she tells them they both are very lucky that Mahavir is thinking about their career and life and not getting them married at such an early age unlike her family is doing. They realize their mistake and starts training real hard.When Geeta the elder sister is ready, Mahavir takes them to another village for wrestling. All the people oppose that they won't let a girl fight with a boy but due to lack of audience and as a means of earning more money the organizer agrees. Almost all village arrives to see a girl fighting and every one is positive that she will lose very badly. Geeta chooses the most strong boy among the competitors to wrestle. She fights real good as opposed to what villagers were thinking and as the fight continues every one in crowd starts cheering for Geeta. At end, even though she loses, she wins more prize money from sponsors then the boy.Due to the lose, Geeta is not able to sleep and asks his father when will the next wrestling fight be organized.

Geeta soon befriends with other girls and starts doing other things like shopping, having longer hair, nail polish and makeup, roaming around nights etc apart from her training. When she goes home after few months, she tries to teach her new style of wrestling to her sister Babita and other girls who have now joined Mahavir's Wrestling ring to learn. Seeing that Geeta is very firmly advocating her new methods, Mahavir challanges her but as he is old-age he loses. Since the fight happens very ferociously Babita tells Geeta that whatever happened is not good and Geeta is losing focus. Mahavir is also upset about the incident and thinks that he has lost her daughter.Geeta starts competing in International matches but she keeps match-after-match. At first she does not even care, but slowly she starts being afraid of her career. Meanwhile, Babita also wins National Championship and is moved on to same training centre as Geeta. When Geeta is despaired due to her continue failure, Babita tells her to make amends with father which Geeta does so while crying very much over phone. Mahavir forgives her. Geeta becomes her old-self by cutting her hair-down again. But she is told by the Coach to not compete in her regular 55-kg weight group but to lose weight and compete in 51-kg group. Listening to this, Mahavir shifts to Patiala near to NSA Training Centre so that he can help her compete for the same 55-kg group. He tells Geeta to do as her coach says during training session but both sisters and Mahavir starts doing separate sessions by their old routing of waking up at 5am. Coach notices that and complains to the authority to send both sisters back. Mahavir pleads to the authority of letting them stay but gets banned from NSA and girls are also banned to go out. So Mahavir starts training Geeta over phone by watching all her International competing games video recording and telling her at which moment she is doing what mistake.When Commonwealth Games 2010 is organized in New Delhi, India - Geeta takes part in her usual 55-kg group. Mahavir sits in audience and keeps on advising her against what her NSA coach tells her to do. Doing according to her father's advice she wins the first round and semi-finals as well and is qualified for Finals. In a press conference, the coach tries to take all credit but Geeta gives statement that it is all her father's hard-work. Due to this, the coach gets jealous and angry and to take revenge, before starting the Finals match, locks Mahavir in a room and thinks that let's see how she wins now without her father? Mahavir tries to get out of the room but all his efforts are in vain.The match starts and Geeta keeps remembering her father's advice. After very tough fight Geeta ultimately wins India's first gold medal in women's wrestling in the 55 kg freestyle category against Emily Bensted from Australia. When the ceremony of giving medal to participants is over and according to the rule, winning country's National Anthem is played - Mahavir who hears Indian National Anthem understood that her daughter has finally completed his dream. The room gets unlocked and he rushes towards arena. Geeta shows Mahavir the Gold Medal and for the first-time ever both girls and the nephew Omkar hear their father saying, \"Well-done!\"."
