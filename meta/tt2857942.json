  "overview": "The film follows four high school boys: nerd buddies Yong and Jay, selected to represent the school in a science competition; ambitious Best who wants to make the school ping-pong team, knowing a scholarship could ease his family\u2019s financial burden; and Em who, after quitting school and joining vocational college, follows his Korean obsession by becoming the leader of a dance group, and is also trying to win back his ex-girlfriend, Fieng. The four boys, driven by very different reasons, end up praying before the Luang Poo idol at the spirit house near their school, promising to give the idol a Thai dance if their wishes come true. While not all believe in the powers of the sacred spirit, the boys enlist Nut, a transgender professional dancer, to teach them some moves.",
