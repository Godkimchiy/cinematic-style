  "plot": "Vedivazhipadu describe the events in a time frame of 24 hours on the Pongala festival day at the Attukal Temple. Three friends, Sanjay (Saiju Kurup), Pradeep (Sreejith Ravi) and Rahul (Murali Gopy), have made secret plans for the day when their wives will be away attending the festival. Sanjay, who is a cashier in a bank, is married to Rashmi (Anusree), a bold and outgoing TV journalist who is a star in her own right. She has been covering the Pongala live for her channel. It does not take us long to guess who is the boss here. Pradeep is an investor in stocks and does his business with the help of stockbroker Joseph (Indrajith). Pradeep is married to Vidya (Mythili), a French teacher. They are mismatched, as he looks rustic and she is sophisticated. Rahul is a geeky video games tester working from home. He is married to Radhika (Anjana), a docile housewife. On the said day, the friends gather in Rahul\u2019s apartment. They have booze and a woman (Anumol) and plans to enjoy themselves.",
