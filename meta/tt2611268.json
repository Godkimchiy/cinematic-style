  "overview": "In order to rescue his father's ramshackle grill restaurant, filmmaker and vegetarian Dario Aguirre is traveling back to his homeland Ecuador. What starts out as a strange debate about opening times, chips and Excel spread sheets, develops into a moving family drama.",
  "storyline": "My father Cesar thought I was going to take over his grill restaurant in Ecuador, but I decided to pursue art instead and went to Germany. Ten years later he calls me to let me know that his restaurant is bankrupt, that he has not paid the rent in over two years and is in debt to the bank. After years of no contact, saving the restaurant becomes our joint project. Cesar's Grill tells the story of my return to Ecuador, where I, the vegetarian son, try to solve the problems of my passionately carnivorous father. What starts out as an absurd mission, develops to be a touching story about unfulfilled expectations, becoming an adult and responsibility for each other.",
  "plot": "The film narrates the events of 1988, when Cesar Chavez began his \"Fast for Life,\" a 36-day water-only hunger strike, to draw attention to the horrific effects of unfettered pesticide use on farm workers, their families, and their communities.",
