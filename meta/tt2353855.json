Traveling through these three cities, we will meet different organized groups who will describe their proposals and attitudes towards their sexual orientation. With a riveting and edgy style, Born Naked (MLB) introduces us to individuals who refuse to be labeled by society. A generation who fights for their right to reinvent themselves.",
