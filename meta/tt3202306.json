  "storyline": "Ex-cons Victor 'Vic' and Rico kidnap millionaire Temming's daughter Laura for a huge ransom in cash. She's handled roughly by the masked pair, stripped to pee in bottle - The men became gay lovers, apparently in jail, but while Vic's away to negotiate and collect the money, Rico reveals himself to Laura, being her forbidden lover, promising they can now enjoy the luxury life her father denied them. Her traitorous refusal to accept the gift, cruelly tricking Rico, and inability to keep things secret from Vic put all three in successive dangers.",
