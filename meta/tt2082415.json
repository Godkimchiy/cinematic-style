  "overview": "A group of American GIs work their way through war-torn France during the final days of the Second World War.",
  "storyline": "On August 15, 1944 the 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team (PRCT) jumped over the south of France. Their mission was to support and protect the Allied Troops marching to Berlin. Landing in enemy territory, they fell under immediate attack. In their effort to complete the mission and rendez-vous with their unit, three isolated paratroopers come across a group of French resistants in desperate need. They decide to help liberate some of the captive Partisans. Doing so they will risk their lives.",
  "plot": "Members of the American 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team parachute into Occupied France as part of Operation Dragoon and come under fire, getting separated from their units. Three paratroopers, Sgt. Caleb Jones (David Nibley), T/5. James Rossi (Corbin Allred), and Cpl. Harland \"Bud\" Curtis (Jasen Wade), meet and begin making their way to their intended drop zone in Les Arcs. En route, they encounter members of the French Resistance and small infantry and armored patrols of the German Army. Flashbacks show some of the back story of the Resistance fighters as well as the airborne soldiers' lives back home, and reciting of the 'airborne creed' becomes a touchstone for continued perseverance and offensive action under fire.\n\nOne skirmish ends with Sgt. Jones capturing a German captain, Erich Neumann (Lincoln Hoppe), alone in the woods; an off-camera gunshot suggests that he has shot the captain. As the group travels together, Rossi begins a flirtation with Emilie (Virginie Fourtina Anderson), an attractive young female Resistance fighter. Later, the paratroopers and Resistance ambush a small German tank convoy. Casualties are high on both sides, including Rossi, who apparently dies from his wounds in the hands of the same German officer who had been caught earlier by Jones.\n\nNeumann carries Rossi's body to an abandoned warehouse. When Rossi regains consciousnesses, he finds that he's been bandaged by the German officer. Neumann tries to make friends, but Rossi questions whether he should hate Neumann and why Neumann didn't hate him. When night falls, Neumann is writing in his notebook and wincing in pain. He pulls back his shirt to reveal he has been shot in the gut. In the morning, Neumann is dead and Rossi is rescued by a patrol of Americans.\n\nIn the regimental field hospital, Rossi learns that Jones was transported to a hospital and Curtis was K.I.A, along with most of the French Resistance members. Rossi again meets Emilie, who has come to look for him. Rossi and Emilie are happy to reunite.",
