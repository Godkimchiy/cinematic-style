They realize that Taylor is missing and the groups goes out to find her and they end up finding Belinda's dead body in the woods. They go back to the house, hoping they could get network there and call for help.

She explains that the girls who came to the ranch 15 years earlier were rude to her and the ranch hand's son helped her take revenge. She further explains she killed all the friends because they cheated Alice by having sex with her husband. She did this because Alice was the only person who was kind to her during her childhood.
