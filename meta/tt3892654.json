  "overview": "The slightly chubby harness racer Bjarte does not get the good horses anymore, and is forced to enter the criminal path in order to keep menacing creditors at bay. A fatal choice of partners ends up in a failed doping attempt, and a consequent kidnapping of the top horse Berlusconi. A bloodthirsty hunting party consisting of two eager financial crime investigators, an unscrupulous horse owner, two Finnish debt collectors, and a particularly unorthodox private investigator called The Animal, are scrambling to find the horse and those who have gone off with it. Bjarte's alibi is falling apart like a rotten racers suit, and his wifes bipolar fluctuations dont help much. What are the odds that a chubby harness racer may outsmart them all?",
  "storyline": "A chubby jockey are no longer getting the best horses to ride, and has to cheat to pay off his considerable debt. A horse drugging goes wrong, and winds up in kidnapping the prizewinner horse Berlusconi.",
