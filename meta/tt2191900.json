  "overview": "This film documents the breadth and depth of Occupy Wall Street and how it quickly grew from a small park in lower Manhattan to an international movement. From a 22 years old business administration graduate Occupier to a 92 years old grandmother, the film explores why people from diverse age, ethnic and financial backgrounds support the movement. The economist Jeffrey Sachs connects the dots between issues that the movement brings to light and how they can be addressed through fair taxation and a reallocation of resources for a more just and sustainable future. Russell Simmons highlights the necessity of removing private money from politics in order to reduce the corporate influence of the legislative process that has undermined democracy. Narrated by Lou Reed.",
