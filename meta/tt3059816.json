  "overview": "Based on true events, The Wannabe, a story about Thomas, a man obsessed with Mafia culture during the 1990s in New York City.  When Thomas\u2019s failed attempts to fix the trial of infamous mobster John Gotti gets him rejected by the people he idolizes most, he sets off on a drug infused crime spree with his girlfriend and longtime mob groupie, Rose, by brazenly robbing the local Mafia hangouts.",
  "storyline": "Obsessed with mob culture, and desperate to fit in, Thomas sets out to fix the 1992 trial of John Gotti. He believes if the plan is executed, it will put him at the center of all that he idolizes. The plot is foiled, setting off events worthy of mob lore. The Wannabe intertwines real people and true events, past and present, with fantasy.",
  "plot": "Steve Williams (Craig Robert Young) was once part of boy band \"Busboyz\", but after surviving a horrific accident which killed the other members of the band, he now finds himself struggling for work, seeking credibility as an actor and the focus of a documentary. After being dropped by his manager for Paul\u2014who was in a boy band rivalling \"Busboyz\"\u2014Steve tries to make his own way through ever more demeaning auditions until he hears of a casting call for a \"Monkees\"-like TV show where he could showcase his acting, dancing and singing talents.\n\nHowever, Steve then learns that Paul has been passing off as his own a dance contest victory which Paul won, and his nemesis is also trying out for the show. With a dance face-off between them on the cards, who will win out?\n\nThe film is directed by Richard Keith and was co-written by Keith and Young. It is based loosely on Young's own experiences as an actor in L.A. and former Pop band member in UK Brit pop band, Deuce.\n\nIt stars Craig Young, Adam Huss, Anna Becker and Liz Warner, with Brian Nahas, Carole Ita White, Eddie Mills, Tate Taylor and Susan Duerden, and also features a cameo by KYLE XY's Matt Dallas. It won the Audience Award Best Feature at Dances with Films 2006.",
