  "overview": "During a layover in Albuquerque, work colleagues Les and Natalie discover more about each other than they ever thought possible.  Anxious and irritable, Les is drawn back into the city by past experiences he can\u2019t forget (even if he doesn't really remember the particulars of his previous drunken adventure).  Natalie, refusing to leave his side, follows along as her own secrets are slowly revealed, leaving her feeling both vulnerable and unbound.",
  "storyline": "Colleagues Les and Natalie are delayed in the Albuquerque airport. Restless, irritated, and unable to stand the service workers he meets at every turn, Les heads downtown. Natalie refuses to leave his side and discovers that his supposedly aimless wandering has more of a point than he is willing to admit. Natalie conceals secrets of her own, though neither can keep them quiet for long. A rapport grows between this unlikely pair, and soon they search out a spark of excitement in this most unlikely of locales.",
  "plot": "Les Moore (Broderick) is a businessman who finds himself delayed in a city where a year earlier a few too many drinks led to an unexpected encounter that has since haunted him. He sets out with his co-worker Natalie Hamilton (Eve) to figure out what really happened.",
