  "overview": "In the late 1980s, the Belgian electronic New Beat music movement conquered dance floors worldwide, and all of a sudden Belgium was on the map. This eclectic predecessor of house music appeared to materialize out of nothing, but according to the makers of The Sound of Belgium, it was the product of a historical search for identity that apparently went back to the Battle of Waterloo and the aftermath of the First World War.",

From the grand dance halls with Decap organs to the golden days of Popcorn; From dark and cold Electronic Body Music and New Beat to Belgian House and Techno An alternative chronicle of unique popular music, 'The Sound of Belgium' goes in search of the spirit of a nation and the people that danced to it.",
