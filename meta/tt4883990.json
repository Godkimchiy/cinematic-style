  "storyline": "There is an elite group that controls the world. They run governments, companies and religions. They control much of what you see, hear and perceive and have done so for a very long time. Their names have changed, their faces altered but their bloodlines remain the same. We see glimpses of their great and far reaching power, we see revolutions and war, and we succumb to their propaganda and manipulation again and again. Most have no idea that they are under the spell. In the 18th century, they emerged into the spotlight briefly to bring about world-wide cataclysmic change and they called themselves the Illuminati. Quickly they spread and embedded themselves and their ideals within other secret societies and have infiltrated every aspect of society on all sides of the fence. This is the story of the world's most powerful secret and sacred order.",
