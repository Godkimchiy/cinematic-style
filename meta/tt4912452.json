  "overview": "Taira Ashihara and his younger brother Shota live by themselves in the small seaport town Mitsuhama in the western part of Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture. Whenever Taira spots someone who looks tough, he provokes them into a fight. Yuya Kitahara becomes interested in him and the two go on a violent streak against people on the street, then they steal a car and head out of town with Nana who was in the car when they stole it. Meanwhile, younger brother Shota comes to Matsuyama to find Taira",
  "storyline": "At some point beating and ravaging others becomes a routine pastime when two kids go on a rampage. Taira picks his target of men and goes for broke, while Kitahara puts down his camera long enough to instead go after women. There is enough blood shed during the course of one night to paint a mural of red for the whole city to see.",
