  "overview": "Several pupils from Ho\u00ebr Volkskool Heidelberg are on their way to compete in a singing competition; but the majority of the school, including the principal, is not supportive. In this school, sport far outweighs culture.  However, this does not stop the singers from the group to follow their passion. The principal wants to sabotage the group\u2019s tour and sends one of the school\u2019s teachers to distract the music teacher.  They eventually arrive at a camp where they are treated as if they were in the army. This is all the principal\u2019s doing.",
  "storyline": "A conventional music teacher lives for his singing group who are outcasts at their sport-mad school. Circumstances force the group to stand up for what they believe in, because when they sing, they find meaning in life.",
