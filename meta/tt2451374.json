When Linda's father in law mysteriously disappears, Wallander is drawn into the case that takes him back in time to the Cold War and the submarine violations in the Stockholm archipelago. At the same time he's starting to suspect that something is not right with him...",

With time on his hands, he looks into the disappearance of his daughter's father-in-law who may have been involved in the death of a young sailor during an international incident back in the '80's with a submarine entering Swedish waters.",
