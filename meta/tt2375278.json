  "synopsis": "Kat and Samantha have been best friends for years. Kat is given a couples weekend workshop as a birthday gift by her mother (never mind that her relationship with her ex-boyfriend has been over for six months). Samantha never seems to have a problem finding men to date - they just never seem to last. Samantha convinces Kat to take advantage of the idyllic retreat by pretending to be lovers - how hard could it be? They expect some down time by the pool and maybe a few good stories to bring home with them. \u00a0What they don't expect is to get immersed in a world where they are surrounded by couples who are fighting to keep their relationships strong, and by default, make Samantha and Kat face their own shortcomings as they find themselves having to work on their relationship that isnt really a relationship. During an intense few days, they find the lines between reality and fiction start to blur. Could it be there is really something there, or has the Closer to Closeness weekend just worked a Jedi mind trick on them?"
