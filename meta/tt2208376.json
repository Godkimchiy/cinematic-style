Since Jewel's recent unemployment, Nathan has found himself baring the financial brunt and to make matters worse, Jewel's Pregnant. Since their car was stolen, He takes the transit home late at night and has become increasingly moody thus blaming her for their situation. During such an argument, they hear a noise and Nathan pulls a gun from the closet resulting in another fight about having a weapon in the house. Unable to reach a compromise, they sleep apart.

While walking home, he's followed by a car full of criminal friends from his past, Darrell (Sharieff Pugh), the thuggish leader, Isaac (Kibwe Miller), the follower and Tank (Bryant Pearson), the muscle. They give Nathan a ride home, influencing him to partake in their intoxicants, as they plea for a couple nights stay at his place. Since Nathan pays the bills, he feels more controlling and over-rules Jewel's dismay of his guests. His intoxication has made him unreasonable and auspicious of his friends' behavior. Jewel watches helplessly as her boyfriend reminisces with his old friends, drinking and smoking. Tank tries to be-friend Jewel by cooking her breakfast, being nice and courteous until she eventually warms to her new guests. Although Nathan's friends charm Jewel's worries away temporarily, their criminal behavior is confirmed, when she discovers that they are indeed fugitives. Instead of fleeing, they force their old partner to partake in a robbery by threatening his fianc\u00e9e's life. Knowing his partners will likely kill them afterwards; he must now find a way to stop his past from destroying his future."
