When the plane carrying the young woman to her small village in the Alps is reported to have crashed in the mountains, Sebastian is convinced that Angelina is still alive. Along with his faithful dog Belle, Sebastian embarks on the most dangerous adventure of his life . . .",
  "plot": "In the French Alps, during the year 1943, S\u00e9bastien is a seven year old orphan boy living with C\u00e9sar, an adoptive \"grandfather\" and his daughter, Ang\u00e9lina. The unusual little family lives in the small village of Saint-Martin, whose inhabitants, despite the German occupation, secretly organize the passage of Jewish exiles into Switzerland. The village is also plagued by a mysterious \"Beast\" who preys on the flocks of the shepherds and the inhabitants, including C\u00e9sar's animals. S\u00e9bastien is a very lonely child who is suffering from the absence of his mother. He believes that she migrated \"to America, just over the mountains\", and spends all his days in the mountains. One day, on the way home, he meets a huge dog, wild and completely discredited: it is the so-called \"Beast\". S\u00e9bastien is not slow to make friends with the animal, a female livestock guardian dog, and names her \"Belle\" because he is struck by her beauty after she is cleaned up from the mud that she was coated with. S\u00e9bastien decides to keep his friendship with Belle a secret to protect her.\n\nMeanwhile, a German patrol, commanded by the ambiguous Lieutenant Peter Braun, arrives in Saint-Martin to put an end to the secret escape route of the Jews. S\u00e9bastien, during one of his trips along with Belle, collides with two of the soldiers; Belle responds by attacking and injuring one of the soldiers. Lieutenant Peter Braun orders the mayor of Saint-Martin to arrange a hunt to track down and kill the \"Beast\". Meanwhile, C\u00e9sar discovers S\u00e9bastien's secret and is horrified. Knowing that S\u00e9bastien will try to prevent Belle from being shot, C\u00e9sar gives the boy the wrong directions to the hunting area. But he is still able to interfere, at least for a while. Then C\u00e9sar takes him out of the area, while the hunt goes on. C\u00e9sar and the village men manage to find and hurt Belle. S\u00e9bastien escapes confinement, and finds the wounded dog and tries to help her. He is now furious with C\u00e9sar, but asks for help from Dr. Guillaume, the village doctor and Ang\u00e9lina's boyfriend. After an initial hesitation, (and being prodded with a con from S\u00e9bastien) he agrees to treat Belle and saves her life.\n\nUnbeknownst to S\u00e9bastien, Dr. Guillaume is also the one who is responsible for escorting the Jews to the Swiss border. One evening, the doctor hides a family in a cave prior to a trip to the border, when the sound of wolves is heard in the valley. The doctor goes out as the wolves start causing a ruckus in the sheepfold. Guillaume slips and falls into the sheepfold as Belle bounds down out of nowhere and drives off the wolves. The doctor sits up and moans: his ankle is broken, he cannot walk. He finds a sled, lies down on it, and starts pawing his way to town when Belle stops him, picks up the rope, and begins to tow him. She takes him to Ang\u00e9lina's house where everyone except S\u00e9bastien and Guillaume is surprised by the dog. C\u00e9sar instantly apologizes to S\u00e9bastien for wanting to kill Belle.\n\nGuillaume, who is now injured, can no longer lead the Jews and his place is taken by Ang\u00e9lina and S\u00e9bastien, who followed her and sneaked into the cave behind her. The boy befriends Esther, the daughter of the two refugees that Guillaume was to escort, and by talking with her, he discovers that C\u00e9sar lied to him about where America truly is. That evening, S\u00e9bastien creeps back into town and sneaks into the schoolhouse to look at a map. Later, C\u00e9sar discovers him in the schoolhouse and reveals the truth: his mother died while giving birth to him. C\u00e9sar was present by chance and agreed to take care of S\u00e9bastien; he has so far been silent or preferring to lie to protect him. S\u00e9bastien is sad, but now he knows he can always count on C\u00e9sar and he makes peace with him. It is Christmas Eve, and C\u00e9sar gives him a treasured gift: a pocket watch with a compass, which will come in handy shortly.\n\nMeanwhile, the Germans realize that some Jews might try to escape on Christmas Day and begin to scour the mountain passes. Ang\u00e9lina and the Jews leave the cave, but the trip is cut short by Lieutenant Peter. He shouts to her, and she herds the family faster up the mountain. He shouts to her again, but all of them are suddenly overwhelmed by an avalanche caused by his shouts. Lt. Peter, when dug out of the snow, surprisingly warns her to take another route to reach the border because his soldiers are patrolling the mountain. Ang\u00e9lina is moved, and kisses the man. The only possible way now is dangerous and full of crevasses; S\u00e9bastien boasts that Belle, thanks to her sense of smell, will guide them. Not without difficulty, Belle, S\u00e9bastien and Ang\u00e9lina manage to escape from the Germans and to bring the Jews to Switzerland where they are greeted by a local guide. Here, Ang\u00e9lina reveals that she will go on to England to help win the war. She promises S\u00e9bastien that she will return once it's all over, leaving Belle and S\u00e9bastien to walk back home, all alone. The Swiss guide questions her if she is sure that he is able to make such a long, difficult journey on his own, but Ang\u00e9lina, in tears, replies that S\u00e9bastien is not all alone.",
