But instead of finding peace, he has to deal with a kooky neighbour, a missing drowned man, a crook on the lam, a stripper who hides out with him, and the cop who\u2019s madly in love with her and looking for her with murderous ardour.",
  "storyline": "When betrayed by his family, a man calling itself Fred Moreau escapes with a briefcase full of stolen money. He hides in a cottage on the shore of Lake Kaionwahere, believing to be quiet with his dog Jules. Soon, however, he meets his only neighbor, a mysterious fisherman, and a dancer who is hiding from him while a policeman in love with her trying to find her. While a criminal on the run was seen in the area and a mysterious drowning remains found, Fred begins to suspect that a mystery surrounds the lake.",
