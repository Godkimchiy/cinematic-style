As the two agents gradually develop a mutual professional respect, they also begin to unravel a far-reaching criminal conspiracy that puts all the citys residents at grave risk.Archer must also deal with his terminally ill mother, the towns Vice Mayor Elizabeth Archer (Morgan Fairchild), whose family secrets she has kept from her son his entire life. The Mayors most trusted aide James Durant (Chris Carmack), whose access to the Mayors life is unsurpassed, seems above reproach until he announces his own candidacy for the open Mayoral seat.As their investigation deepens, the agents suddenly realize that they are confronted by a mysterious, centuries-old, powerful adversary, and they cannot trust anyone other than each other. When Archer and Driver suddenly become the hunted -- solving the murders becomes secondary to their own survival."
