  "overview": "Adapted freely from the classic novella 'The Mysterious Stranger' by Mark Twain; STRANGER revives a subculture of cinema dug up from way back in the late 1960's and early 1970's when visions of the counterculture broke out onto the big screen. Classic examples merged the Western genre with 'hippy' ideals and political satire peppered with surrealism, psychedelia and absurdity. This resulted in some of the most memorable exercises of transgressive cinema; marrying trash and high art with a Western setting. Prime examples include the notorious \"El Topo\" by Alejandro Jodorowsky and \"Greaser's Palace\" by Robert Downey. STRANGER will assault the senses, inheriting the guerilla, no-holds-barred spirit of the underground classics before it.",
  "storyline": "Caine Farrowood is a bounty hunter who works under the control of ruthless kingpin Loomweather. One day a bounty retrieval goes awry and Caine is left for dead. Just when he thinks his life is over he mysteriously awakens back home to the comforts of his wife Christina. Baffled and confused by how he got home Caine insists on finding answers, but before long he is enlisted in the retrieval of another bounty. This one is huge and may cost Caine not his life, but his sanity when he finds himself pitted against somebody who may very well be the fallen angel himself.",
  "plot": "Crusty Dr. McRory (Barry Fitzgerald) of Fallbridge, Maine, hires a replacement for his vacation sight unseen. Alas, he and young singing doctor Jim Pearson (Bing Crosby) don't hit it off, but Pearson is delighted to stay, once he meets teacher Trudy Mason (Joan Caulfield). The locals, taking their cue from McRory, cold-shoulder Pearson, especially Trudy's stuffy fianc\u00e9e. But then, guess who needs an emergency appendectomy.",
