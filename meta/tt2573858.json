  "overview": "At his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s urging, a very modern Irish groom-to-be reluctantly agrees to a stag weekend with his friends, camping in the western wilderness of Ireland. Much to their chagrin, these modern men are joined by the brother of the bride, a crazy, unpredictable alpha male known as \u201cThe Machine\u201d, and an explosive Id to their collective Ego. The Machine is a force of nature, and under his leadership, the men\u2014stripped of modern comfort, convenience and, finally, clothing\u2014must begin their journey into the wild.",

  "plot": "A stag weekend in the great outdoors in the west of Ireland takes some unexpected detours.\n\nArrow Films' synopsis of The Stag is as follows: \"Self-confessed metrosexual Fionn\u00e1n doesn't want a stag do, but would happily attend the Hen. Ruth, the now concerned bride-to-be (Amy Huberman), promptly persuades the, marginally more-macho, best man (Andrew Scott) to organise one. Reluctantly, he agrees but proceeds to do everything he can to stop Ruth's wildly infamous brother, known only as The Machine (Peter McDonald), coming along for their sober, walking-weekend, excuse for a stag party. But The Machine, not so easily foxed, tracks them down, and what follows is a hilarious few days in rural Ireland where the Stags find themselves lost, shot at, stoned and butt-naked. The Stag is a hilarious and heart-warming journey of friendship, fear, male bonding, and tightly fashioned squirrel skin!\"",
