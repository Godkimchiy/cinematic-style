  "overview": "After retiring from his life as an outlaw, ranch owner Nathaniel Reed (Trace Adkins) quietly leads an honest existence with his devoted wife, Laura Lee. But his gun-slinging past suddenly comes back to haunt him when he learns that the man he once maimed during a stagecoach robbery is now a U.S. Marshal (Kim Coates) who will stop at nothing to find vengeance. After a violent shootout brings tragic consequences, Nathaniel returns to his old ways and becomes Texas Jack: the most wanted outlaw in the West. Judd Nelson also stars in this action-packed quest for redemption filled with galloping getaways, a beautiful bounty hunter and the possibility of a second chance.",
