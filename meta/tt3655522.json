  "plot": "Marieme (Karidja Tour\u00e9) is a 16-year-old African-French teenager living in a poor Paris suburb. Academically Marieme struggles, which forces her into a vocational track where she will learn a certain trade. Due to her mother's demanding work schedule, Marieme's abusive brother is in charge. On her way out of school, the day she found out about vocational school, she is approached by a gang of girls, Lady (Assa Sylla) who is the leader of the group, and her followers, Fily (Marietou Toure), and Adiatou (Lindsay Karamoh), who ask Marieme if she wants to join them for a day trip to the city centre. They wear leather jackets, gold jewelry, and have pin straight hair. Marieme initially declines but after seeing the girls approached by a group of boys, including her brother's friend, Ismael (Idrissa Diabate) whom she has a crush on, Marieme joins them.\n\nThe girls fight, steal, intimidate others but love and support each other. Marieme and the girls grow close and she eventually begins to act and dress just like Lady, Adiatou and Fily. Because of their act of stealing, the entire group of girls pay for a hotel room, steal dresses, drink alcohol, do drugs, dance and lip sync to Diamonds, by Rihanna, and dance all night long. At the hotel Lady encourages Marieme to ignore her abusive older brother's phone calls and gives her a gold necklace with the name Vic for Victory.\n\nFighting assists in showing dominance over other groups. Lady sets up a fight with a girl who is a member of their rival group. Unfortunately, Lady is beaten by this girl, and has her shirt torn off which is viewed as a disgrace. Due to her loss, her father cuts all of her hair off and makes her keep her distance from the group. Vic/Marieme, wants to prove to herself, as well as Lady, that she has the power and strength to fight, and win, the battle against their rival. Vic miraculously wins the battle by ripping the girls shirt off, as well as cutting her bra leaving her topless. Both Lady and Vic's brother are incredibly proud of her and approving of her feat.\n\nAfterwards Vic leaves home and starts to work for Abou, a local drug dealer. While working for Abou, Vic lives in an apartment with two male roommates. In order not to be sexualized she binds her breasts and wears loose baggy clothing. When her boyfriend discovers she has been binding her breasts they fight. Afterwards she goes to a party at Abou's place where, despite her dressed down look Abou approaches and tries to kiss her. She tells him no and pushes him away. Vic goes to her boyfriend's place to tell him she's done with Abou and he offers to let her stay at his place and marry her. Vic refuses telling him she doesn't want that kind of life. She attempts to go back home, but despite being buzzed into her building she finds herself unable to go in.",
