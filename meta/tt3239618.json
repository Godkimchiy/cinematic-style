  "overview": "While navigating life with his hyper-protective mother along the enigmatic Outer Banks of North Carolina's coast (site of the first attempted English settlement in the New World), conflicted teen Loren learns of his expecting girlfriend's ambivalence toward him. After a near tragic accident, he must learn to assemble the broken pieces into a stronger, wiser form and approach a more worldly consciousness. A searchlight cast upon the earliest traces of America and the mystery of settlers vanished, Lost Colony scans a once virgin watershed for signs of life.",
  "storyline": "Poetic, mysterious and visually elegant, Christopher Holmes' debut feature forges an impressionistic coming-of-age narrative as prismatic as the ever-changing strand of shoreline the story inhabits. With refreshing sincerity and an unassuming sense of humor, Lost Colony considers the lives of conflicted teen Loren, his hyper-protective mother Patricia, and others like them along the Outer Banks of North Carolina's coast- site of the first attempted English settlement in the New World. As Loren begins to sense the widening distance between himself and his expecting girlfriend Ramona, a near tragic accident threatens to capsize their world and forces a reckoning with the delicate mythology he has crafted to make sense of it. A searchlight cast upon the earliest traces of America and the mystery of settlers vanished, Lost Colony scans a once virgin watershed for signs of life.",
