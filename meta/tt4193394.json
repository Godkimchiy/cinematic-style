  "overview": "In 1951, Marcus Messner, a working-class Jewish student from New Jersey, attends a small Ohio college, where he struggles with anti-Semitism, sexual repression, and the ongoing Korean War.",
  "storyline": "Set in 1951, the story follows Marcus Messner, the idealistic son of a humble kosher butcher from Newark, N.J. Marcus leaves for Ohio to study at a small, conservative college, where he finds himself at odds with the administration, grapples with anti-Semitism and sexual repression and pines after a troubled girl.",
  "plot": "Set against the backdrop of the Korean War, a working-class Jewish student, Marcus (Logan Lerman), leaves Newark, New Jersey, to attend a small college in Ohio. There, he experiences a sexual awakening after meeting the elegant and wealthy Olivia (Sarah Gadon), and confronts the school's dean (Tracy Letts) over the role of religion in academic life. Olivia is a straightforward girl who, having gone unloved much of her life, has high expectations for her relationship for Marcus. After Marcus is pressured by his mother into ending the relationship, Olivia ends up in a hospital under psychiatric observation, and ultimately remains there until her death. Marcus meanwhile leaves college and joins the army to fight in the Korean War. There he is stabbed by a North Korean soldier, and in his last moments, thinks regretfully that he wishes Olivia to know of his continued feelings for her.",
