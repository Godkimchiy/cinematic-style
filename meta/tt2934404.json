  "overview": "Contemporary Moscow, home to several people who apparently lead a totally carefree life. They have all acquired status in society, and at first sight seem to have everything they desire. But each of them is lacking something, and each has their own intimate secret.",
  "storyline": "\"Intimate Parts\" is an ironic melodrama about middle-class Muscovites. Each of them has a personal secret, hidden from others - the \"intimate part\". The main character, a scandalous photographer Ivan, juxtaposes himself to others. He is convinced that people are born to be happy; and happiness is freedom to stay true to one's self. The real question is: how safe is it to let your inner self out?",
