So he rallies together his best man Leon, and his buddies Terence and Roy to head deep into the mountains of Argentina for an epic bachelor party trip. At their hotel in a remote village, they are surprised when Max, one of Henry's oldest friends, shows up unexpectedly. The guys drink heavily and get down to the usual bachelor party business. Everyone seems to be having a good time, except for a few nasty outbursts from Max, who seems a bit unhinged. The next day, despite warnings from locals about a spirit protecting the mountain, the guys set off hiking. Shortly into the hike that nobody but Henry really wants to be on, tempers fray, old feuds re-emerge, and Terence storms off. When the guys find his bloody shirt, they fear the worst. What actually happens is more terrifying than anyone - even Henry -could have imagined.",
