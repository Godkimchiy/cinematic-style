  "overview": "When an ambitious journalist exposes a barbaric practice occurring in a town near New Delhi, all of India becomes embroiled in the resulting scandal.",
  "storyline": "Set in the present times against two backdrops, New Delhi with its shining buildings and apparent cosmopolitan veneer, thinly veils an underbelly of crimes against women and corruption at all levels. And a small village just 80 kilometers from New Delhi that is stuck in a time warp. Kajarya a woman in her early thirties has a strange but important place in the village social structure; she murders unwanted girl infants in the garb of religion. Meera is a rookie reporter. She breezes into the village and the villagers feed her the story of Kajarya being a demonic baby killer. The story is juicy and one sided. Meera gets the front page of the newspaper. Kajarya goes to jail.",
