It was her spirit who brought dinner for them.\n\nOn that day when they are about leave Valparai, they are confronted by Ram and Ayesha, Aravind says that he is ready to die for this friend and says the story. It was Ram's birthday, so to surprise him, Aravind had told him to come to a place. The place is then revealed to be the Register's office to get Ram and Ayesha married. Aravind wanted to surprise Ram by giving him a birthday gift who is going to be Ayesha. So he mischievously lies telling that his parents will not accept Ayesha and tells him to stop spoiling Ayesha's life. Taking this seriously Ram commits suicide. Aravind feels sorry for him and asks to take his life but after forgiving him.\n\nRam says he either has to kill Aravind or he needs to live a life through Aravind. The screen goes blank and after few weeks, Aravind is engaged to the same girl who was possessed in the beginning which implies that Ram and Ayesha will live together with the help of Aravind and his wife.",
