  "overview": "A couple are given a camera and a set of instructions which they must follow or else someone will die.",
  "storyline": "The middle class Emmy receives a video camera at home and her husband Tom starts filming. They believe they won a prize from the mall. The college student Beth is alone and bored in the empty campus and also receives a camera. Out of the blue, they are instructed to film and not call the police; otherwise they will die. Meanwhile the unemployed Leonard that lives with his mother receives a clown outfit and make-up and instructions to receive ten thousand dollars. After moments of tension, their lives are tragically entwined. Who is the stranger behind the prank?",
  "plot": "This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (February 2015)\nThe film follows three groups of people, all of whom have found a video camera on their doorstep and begin filming under the impression that this is the key to winning money from a mysterious competition. Tom (Todd Stashwick) is an average guy filming the life of his family with his wife Emmy. Beth (Alexandra Lydon) is a bored and isolated college girl who sees the camera as something to fill her free time. Leonard (Barak Hardley) is a mother's boy who believes his clown makeup will steal the scene. Each group has been given a label - \"The Family\" (Tom &amp; Emmy), \"The Woman\" (Beth), and \"The Clown\" (Leonard), but they are largely unaware of what is truly going on and are shocked when they receive instructions telling them to keep filming or die.",
