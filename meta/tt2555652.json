  "overview": "An investigative reporter finds the will to live again after discovering an enigmatic commune.",
  "storyline": "Alice is a young investigative reporter. She suffers a sorrowful loss but finds an enigmatic commune where she starts to find her will to live and love again.",
  "plot": "Alice is a young investigative reporter who suffers a catastrophic loss when her boyfriend, Tom, commits suicide. She finds it impossible to cope in the real world and goes in search of an isolated community run by a former psychiatrist she learned about as part of a story. She finds the community, and infiltrates it by pretending to have forgotten her identity. Alice slowly finds acceptance in this commune and learns that each member has suffered a tremendous loss or trauma, and the group intends to commit a mass suicide together. One of the residents, Charlie, finds Alice's hidden I.D. card and threatens to expose her lie. Alice convinces him to keep her secret for the time being, and the two begin a romantic relationship. After realizing how supported she feels by the group, Alice reveals her identity and is allowed to stay with the group.\n\nAlice tries to come to terms with ending her life, but is not fully committed. When the director of the commune, Niel, accidentally ends the life of his sick wife--the group decide that now is the time. Alice tries to convince Charlie to run away and start over with her, but he refuses telling her she can leave if she wants. She decides to stay, and the next morning the group prepares to \"let go.\" As Alice takes the poisoned cup from Neil, Charlie stops her. He agrees to go away with her and assures the group he won't let them be disturbed. The final scene shows Alice and Charlie boarding a train together.\n\n.",
