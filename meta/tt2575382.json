  "overview": "Released from prison and terminally ill, Parvis Karimpour is determined to be reunited with his daughter, Nasrin, who fled Iran for Europe many years before. Crossing the Mediterranean only to be unceremoniously dumped on the Spanish coast, Karimpour makes for Madrid in search of his erstwhile only child. Along the way he meets failed Italian pianist Fabrizio and spoilt German dreamer Almut \u2013 fellow migrants struggling to make their way in a Europe beset by economic turmoil. The search for Nasrin lends Karimpour\u2019s new friends a sense of purpose, and the unlikely threesome take up her trail.",
  "storyline": "Facing death, terminally ill Parvis Karimpour wants to reconcile with his daughter Nasrin. He and his fellow African travellers are dumped from a boat by the Spanish coast at dawn. He makes his way to Madrid where he believes his only child, who fled from Iran years ago, may now live. Finding shelter in a city which is battered by the economic crisis, Parvis meets two other struggling migrants. The Italian Fabrizio, a failed piano player, survives on odd cleaning jobs. Spoilt young German Almut, on the other hand, has followed her boyfriend to Madrid. Looking for a direction in life she dreams of opening a jewellery shop. The search for Nasrin becomes their common quest. Parvis regains hope, while his newfound optimism snaps Fabrizio and Almut out of their lethargy. Following a new clue the three set off northwards in Almut's car.",
