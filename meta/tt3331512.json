  "overview": "Taking place in 1955 in Italy, \u201cCastello Cavalcanti\u201d follows Jason Schwartzman as race car driver Jed Cavalcanti who suffers a mishap during the Motle Miglia rally and finds himself in a small town with a few familial surprises.  Directed by Wes Anderson.",
  "storyline": "Italy, September 1955. A Formula One driver crashes his car during a race, leaving him stuck in a small village but good surprises will come his way.",
  "plot": "In a quiet Italian village in 1955, American Formula One driver Jed Cavalcanti (Jason Schwartzman), who is struggling in last place in a race through the countryside, crashes his car in the middle of the public square. Irritated with his situation, he abandons his car, blames the malfunctions on his brother-in-law (who is also his mechanic), and waits for the next bus out of town, which is set to arrive in 20 minutes. However, after sharing a drink with the villagers, he discovers that he is in his ancestral homeland, \"Castello Cavalcanti\", and that several members of his company are his \"ancestors\". After a friendly phone call with his brother-in-law, he soon decides to skip the next bus and spend more time in town.",
  "synopsis": "In a small Italian village, there are people seated outside a caffe. People are chatting, drinking, and playing cards and you see a boy with a small Formula One toy car. A car horn can be heard from a distance and the villagers produce small flags as if expecting the race to come by. Through an archway, a motorcycle leads a groups of race cars and there is indiscernible shouting from the drivers. Cars drive by while a man takes pictures and the villagers cheer, waving their flags. Then we hear Jed Cavalcanti (Jason Swartzman) coming up behind shouting, \"Goddammit!\" and the car crashes offscreen. The caption tells the viewer that the setting is Italy, September 1955. We see Jed sitting in a burning Formula One car and he quickly gets out and runs into the caffe to get water. Some men help Jed to put out the fire. Jed is cursing and blaming the crash on the car. Jed is speaking English with an American accent to the villagers who are all speaking Italian. Frustrated, Jed sits with the men playing cards and asks when the next bus is. He is still complaining about the construction of the car. When he finds out the name of the town, Castello Cavalcanti, Jed realizes that his family originated from this town and greets the villagers as family. One of the villagers is Jed's great great grand uncle, and Jed kisses him. Jed goes into the caffe to take a phone call from his significant other (wife or girlfriend, we don't know). He tells her that he crashed and tells her where he is. He complains more about the car, blaming it for the crash. The bus arrives and when Jed asks how much for the drink, the hostess tells him it's on the house. When Jed insists, the hostess and voices in the background tell him it's on the house. Jed decides to wait for the next bus and orders a plate of spaghetti."
