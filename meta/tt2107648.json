After the loss on a nearby hill, luck and good fortune brings them back to their parents the next day, both parents trying to find out what happened during the disappearance. Following their return, changes occur in the behavior of the children that suggest ominous and unspeakable events that recall the night when the children were lost.\n\nThe couple hear of legends about unwary people and diabolical secrets of the caves in the area and have a friend investigate the caves. The children are distraught after his return and he is shaken. The mother ventures to the legends' cave and discovers her children's bodies, finally confirming the two imposters are dangerous and the friend saw the dead bodies. She poisons the pair and takes her husband to the cave where he confirms the bodies. He then shoots his wife and himself. Minutes later, imposter bodies drive away in the parents' car.",
