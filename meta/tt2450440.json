  "overview": "Errol Flynn, the swashbuckling Hollywood star and notorious ladies man, flouted convention all his life, but never more brazenly than in his last years when, swimming in vodka and unwilling to face his mortality, he undertook a liaison with an aspiring actress, Beverly Aadland.

  "synopsis": "The true story of Beverly Aadland, a teen starlet who became the last girlfriend of legendary swashbuckler Errol Flynn. In 1957, Beverly was working at Warner Brothers studios with a fake birth certificate saying she was 18 -- she was in fact, only 15 -- when she encountered the former matinee idol. After a difficult start, the two undertook a relationship that was ultimately embraced by Beverly's Hollywood mother Florence, who became a willing third wheel. The affair took them from L.A. to New York to Africa, then to Cuba where Flynn pitched in with the rebels to make a pro-Castro propaganda movie starring Beverly. It all came crashing to an end in Vancouver, however, when Flynn died in Beverly's arms. Only then did it come out publicly that she was underage, causing an explosion in the national press; Florence finally achieved the attention she sought in the form of tabloid notoriety but the chaos drove Beverly to the edge of her sanity. The Last of Robin Hood is a poignant yet darkly comic coming-of-age tale about the desire for fame and the price it exacts."
