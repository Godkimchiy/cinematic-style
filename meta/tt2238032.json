  "overview": "A detective from Hong Kong teams up with an American gambler to battle against a notorious Chinese criminal.",
  "storyline": "Still blaming himself for the untimely demise of his best friend after nine long years, the veteran Hong Kong police detective, Bennie Chan, still finds himself on a wild-goose chase, trying to expose the elusive criminal kingpin known only as \"The Matador\". So far, nothing has changed, and Bennie's main suspect--the corrupt entrepreneur, Victor Wong--is, above all, legally untouchable. However, when Samantha--his late partner's only daughter--has a brush with the mob, Bennie will have no other choice but to seek help from an improbable ally: the flamboyant American gambler, Conor Watts, who has serious problems of his own with the Russian mafia. Now, the unlikely duo must cross the vast landscapes of Mongolia and the Gobi Desert to return to Hong Kong in one piece, as the Matador is still unknown. Will Bennie ever find the hard evidence he needs to put him once and for all behind bars?",
  "plot": "Hong Kong detective Bennie Chan (Jackie Chan) has been tracking notorious crime boss \"Matador\" \u2013 whom he believes to be businessman Victor Wong (Winston Chao) \u2013 for over a decade after the death of Bennie's partner Yung (Eric Tsang). When Yung's daughter Samantha (Fan Bingbing) gets into trouble with Wong's crime syndicate, Bennie must track down an American conman, Connor Watts (Johnny Knoxville), who gambles his way through Chinese casinos after being banned in America and he witness the murder of a woman named Esther Yee in Wong's Macau casino. However, before Bennie can find him, Connor is kidnapped by a Russian kingpin to answer for leaving his daughter pregnant.\n\nAfter intercepting several Russians, Bennie rescues Connor. Bennie races against the clock to bring Connor back from Russia to Hong Kong. But after Connor steals Bennie's passport and burns it, the unlikely pair is forced to travel on foot and embark on a perilous adventure from the steppes of Mongolia to the windswept dunes of the Gobi Desert. While on journey, Connor reveals that he has a phone that Esther gave to him before she dies on his side. The phone is encrypted with a thumbprint access. Bennie then learns that the person who is capable to unlock this phone is none other than the \"Matador.\"\n\nConnor sees Wong on the news and recognizes him as Esther's murderer. Bennie learns that Samantha is already taken by Wong's right-hand man, Willie, and his men, threatening to kill her if Bennie refuses to bring the phone back to Hong Kong. Connor parts ways with Bennie, giving him evidence that could lead to Wong's arrest. Reaching Hong Kong, unfortunately the plan doesn't go well when the phone denies access to Wong's thumbprint, meaning that Wong is not Matador at all. Bennie is detained but he later escapes with Connor's help and follows a clue to the whereabouts of Samantha.\n\nBennie's co-worker Leslie informs him that their police captain, Tang (Michael Wong), is now working with Wong. Bennie and Connor sneak to the shipyard where Matador's criminal organization is located and Bennie witnesses Wong being killed by an unseen man. The two are then caught by the men. There, Bennie discovers that \"Matador\" has been the supposedly deceased Yung all along. After Yung confesses to Bennie about faking his death, he goes to find Samantha being locked up in a room. Upon seeing her dad, Samantha becomes frustrated when she learns that he faked his death in order to work as the criminal organization's boss. When a boat hits the cargo ship, the compartment starts to flood. At the same time, Yung locks Samantha up just as the water enters the room. The fight ensues with the Chinese when the Russian gangsters show up \u2014 revealing that Connor is no longer their enemy. With the police surrounding them, Bennie and Yung work together to save Samantha from drowning inside a sinking ship, with Yung committing suicide by drowning himself, because of guilt and shame. The authorities then arrest Tang and Willie.\n\nConnor goes back to Russia in order to see his baby of the kingpin's daughter. He finds out that he is actually not the father. Later, Connor and Samantha surprise Bennie back at his farm, providing him with alpacas to help fulfill his earlier-confessed lifelong dream of running an alpaca farm.",
  "synopsis": "The film opens at the shipyard when Hong Kong detective Bennie Chan (Jackie Chan) finds his partner, Yung, being suited with the bomb. As he arrives, the bomb is less than 30 seconds.

He then jumps off the tower just as the bomb goes off, presumably killing him.Nine years ago, Bennie and his associates consisting Leslie and Esmond attempt to track down Victor Wong - whom they believe he is the matador, a crime boss - at the local town of Hong Kong, only to find Handsome Willie, Wong's right-hand man, along with his henchmen. Bennie sneaks into the building where Willie's men are dealing with the drug products. After he being intercepted with a dog, the tennis ball used to distract the dog accidentally falls into the basement, drawing the attention of the henchmen. After Bennie subdued the rest of the henchmen, while Willie and his men escapes on boat, several buildings were destroyed when Bennie's associates' boat accidentally catches the chain being tied up onto the columns of houses, resulting in a domino effect. Police captain Tang is infuriated to see this result and confronting them for not showing of evidence of Matador's existence.

In their journey, Connor reveals that he has a phone on his hands that Esther handed over him. When they reach Gobi Desert, the motor is run out of fuel, so they walk through the desert in foot. There, the local Mongolian residents spotted the two, so they decide to stay the rest of the night and having entertain and fun with them.The next day, Bennie and Connor eventually reached the Mongolia-China border. Connor recognizes that the man who shot the woman is Victor Wong. In order to get through the border, Connor feigns that Bennie kidnapped him, resulting them to arrest. Upon interrogation to the police, Connor is being charged for murder of Esther Yee and Bennie is charged for linking the murder with Connor. Then they sent back to Hong Kong for detention. While en route, they are ambushed by Russian mafia. After they subdued them, they steal a car and when they realized that the police are chasing them, they decide to travel on the river by boat.\nThey stopped at a local village where they powered up the phone from Esther, but it is encrypted with the thumbprint access and only to unlock the phone is the Matador.Meanwhile in Hong Kong, Willie and his henchmen breaks into Samantha's apartment but they are being subdued by her and escapes.

When he try to put Wong's thumbprint on the phone for the first time, it denies, concluding that Wong is not the Matador at all. Tang then arrests Bennie for the accessory of murder of Esther Yee. Connor, who arrived on time, sees him.Connor poses as the lawyer in order to release Bennie from prison. Bennie discloses the information to Leslie that Captain Tang is working with Wong. They connected the phone to the computer, bypassing the thumbprint, showing the organization logo of the notorious gang which is located at the shipyard. When the two sneaked into the shipyard, Bennie witnesses Wong being killed by unseen man. Unfortunately, both Bennie and Connor got caught by the henchmen. After both being restrained, Yung shows himself, whom he is supposed to be dead. They find that Yung is a real Matador and he is able to unlock the phone that is used to access for transferring money. The reason of faking his death is because Bennie chose honor while he chose power during his police duty course.Yung then goes to find Samantha being locked inside the room, but upon she sees her dad, she becomes frustrated when he learns that he faked his death in order to work as the criminal organization. When Bennie and Connor is about to be killed, the Russian mafia arrives, revealing that Connor is no longer their enemy, and engages a fight with Willie's henchmen. When the boat containing more Chinese henchmen arrives, one of the Russian mafia shoots them that strucks the boat onto the ship, resulting in flooding the compartment. Yung locks her out again just as the water entering the room, but he goes back with the help of Bennie just as the ship almost completely fills up with water. After they successfully rescues Samantha on time, Yung vows Bennie again to protect her before commits suicide by drowning himself. The authorities arrived and arrest Captain Tang and Willie.Connor goes back to Russia to see his newborn baby. Later, Connor and Samantha suprise Bennie with a serene ranch with the alpacas that he wanted before."
