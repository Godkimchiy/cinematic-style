One day when he is in a train, he sees Tanu (Rashi Khanna) proposing to him loudly. He eventually jumps out. Tanu runs away after her friend Rishitha (Himaja) said her act was good, but asked to whom she proposed. Shiva finally follows Tanu. She continuously rejects him. He makes Rishi's marriage with her lover and asks Tanu to turn back if she loves him, or he would never come into her life.But Bhoji Reddy's (Vineet Kumar) men come to beat him because he had beaten up his son. He says that if she turns back, he would beat them up; if she doesn't, he would come with them. Eventually, Abhi (Abhimanyu Singh), who was looking for Shiva, takes Tanu with him. Shiva beats them up after a man says that she turned back. Abhi reveals that Tanu was always his luck and wants to marry her. Shiva takes her away at her wedding, leaving a fight between Abhi and Bhoji. They both unite and search for Shiva. Tanu and Shiva go to Goa. In that time, Tanu falls for him. When she is about to propose to him, he fights with some goons to make two lovers unite. As he is seriously wounded, she asks him either she or they. Shiva eventually supports them, which make her emotional. Bhoji kidnaps her. Shiva's father (Posani Krishna Murali) reveals that his son's real name is Ram. Ram and Shiva are best friends, until Shiva commits suicide. Ram learns that he loved a girl who also committed suicide. He hided this because Ram would risk his life to get them married. After hearing this, Tanu realizes her mistake, Bhoji too gives up, and Abhi goes through memory loss. As the film ends, Tanu meets Shiva at a mall."
