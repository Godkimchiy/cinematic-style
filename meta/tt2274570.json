  "overview": "A horror comedy centered on a guy who learns that his unusual stomach problems are being caused by a demon living in his intestines.",
  "storyline": "Duncan is an average guy who works at an average office job. But he starts to get pains in his stomach whenever he feels stressed out. Things get worse every time he tries to just hide his stress, by burying it inside. It all comes to a head when that \"stress\" is turned in to an actual little beast that exits his body via his butt and takes revenge on the things that stress him out. But it soon starts to threaten the one thing he loves, his wife.",
  "plot": "The film revolves around the story of a man named Duncan who lives with his wife, Sarah, who worries about his constant stress. One day, he schedules an appointment with a gastroenterologist after experiencing a rather serious level of gastric stress the night before. During the appointment, the doctor and nurse spot a large \"polyp\" in his intestinal tract. After seeing a large amount of stress at a very fast pace from work with his boss placing him in charge of releasing employees to home, where a man his age is in a relationship with his mother and his wife is making him see a very eccentric therapist who keeps asking about his father issues, something unusual happens. The polyp forms into a 2-foot-tall sentient being similar in appearance to a demon or alien, and begins killing each person the creature sees as a source of stress with each day. As the bodies stack, and the news continuously counts the attacks as the result of a local rabid raccoon, the therapist informs him that the creature is the living manifestation of his life's stress built up over time, and that mythology of this type of being states that the best way to eliminate it is to bond with it so it doesn't act so irrationally. To start off with, Duncan names this strange and unusual anally-dwelling creature Milo. First, it kills his co-worker, then the E.D. doctor he didn't need, yet who wouldn't stop calling him. Soon enough, it kills his boss in an elevator during an Federal investigation at his office building. When it finally attacks his father, who apparently had a being of the same species, and begins killing the other being, Duncan loses his grip and moves Milo and himself to a hotel room far away and someplace safe. It doesn't work, much as it seems to at first. Milo tracks Sarah down to her house party and a violent battle ensues between Duncan &amp; Milo. It concludes when Duncan dismembers Milo's left arm and legs, and finally saves its life, vowing to never ignore Milo's important influence and make amends with Milo, successfully doing so before Sarah reinserts Milo back up his rear end. The film ends with Milo's bloodline being discovered to be carried on through Duncan's unborn son, the embryo of the new creature being seen in the system of the unborn child.",
