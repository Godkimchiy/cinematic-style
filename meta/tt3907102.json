  "overview": "Best friends Ras and Calvin are street artists with limited resources but  big ambitions to alter their local surroundings for the better. The two  traverse Cali on bike and skateboard, scouting for surfaces to decorate  with whatever paint they can scavenge. Inspired by news of the Arab  Spring uprisings, they dream of collaborating on a vast mural (with  graffiti artist Mario Wize) that will express solidarity with Egypt\u2019s student  demonstrators. As Ras and Calvin explore Cali\u2019s streets and leave their  mark on its underpasses and alleyways, Ruiz Navia\u2019s film bears witness  to a new generation gradually finding its place in a rapidly changing  world.",
  "storyline": "Ras is a construction worker and graffiti artist in his neighborhood of east Cali, Colombia. After he loses his job he sets off on a journey across the city to find another graffiti artist.",
