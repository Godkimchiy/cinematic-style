  "overview": "Katsu (Mitsuko Baisho) is a 73-years-old woman. She often makes trouble with her biting remarks. While raising a daughter alone, Katsu was unable to live the life she wished for.  One day, Katsu goes to a photo studio and takes a picture. She leaves the photo studio, but finds that she is now 20-years-old (Mikako Tabe) again. Katsu changes out of her grandmother clothes, picks out a more youthful style and names herself Setsuko Otori. Later, Katsu decides to take part in a singing contest held in a shopping district. Her singing fascinates the audience and she wins the contest. Katsu begins to move closer to her past dream of becoming a singer.",
  "storyline": "Katsu is now an old woman who even at seventy three has not lost her penchant for being sardonic and dissatisfied. Upon visiting a photography studio her life and body are transported to that of a twenty-year-old girl giving her the opportunity to make up for missing out on her earlier dreams of becoming a singer, a more harmonious family member and to have more fun than life generally afforded her.",
