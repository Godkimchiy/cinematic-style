  "overview": "An obsessed fan and his mother kidnap former 'scream queens' and force them to reenact their famous film roles...with deadly results.",
  "storyline": "It's the present day, and our heroines, real life Scream Queens who starred in those infamous movies back in the 80's and 90's, have gone on with their lives since those days, some still acting or in new businesses of their own. What none of them suspect is that somewhere, down in the basement of an old house, an obsessed fan, Max, sits in the dark, watching clips from those movies over and over, his obsession growing into a diabolical plan. One by one, with his mother's help, he begins to \"collect\" them, transporting them to a makeshift prison he's set up in his basement. The Scream Queens have no idea what's going on, until they find themselves forced to reenact movie scenes from their horror heyday, a nightmarish process since Max remembers every line and gesture and they haven't watched them in years. And they definitely don't remember the new and terrible outcome of the scenes...",
  "plot": "Chino (Derek Ramsay), a rich playboy, meets Lani (Cristine Reyes), a GI baby of a former prostitute, when he visits Angeles City for a bar hopping. During Chino and Lani\u2019s whirlwind romance, Chino gets into a fight with a mayor\u2019s son that leads his brother Sammy (John Estrada) to send him to America. Lani, with no knowledge of Chino\u2019s departure to America, follows Chino to Manila to tell him about her pregnancy. Upon Lani\u2019s visit, Sammy refuses Lani entry to their house. As Sammy leaves the house, not looking at the commotion Lani is causing outside his car, he instructs his driver to ignore Lani\u2019s pleas and carry on driving. The driver accidentally bumps into Lani, causing her miscarriage.\n\nWith nothing else going on for her, Lani holds on to her American dream. Blessed with beauty and a whistle-bait figure, she plans to use these assets to inch her way toward advancing her social status, and subsequently, to plot vengeance against the brothers. Winning Ms. Body Beautiful and working as a joiner in a bar in Manila, Lani monitors the status of Chino and Sammy. Lani\u2019s plot begins to unravel when the American Ambassador takes her to a society ball. As part of the elite, Sammy also attends the ball. Sammy instantly notices Lani\u2019s smashing looks and gets smitten.\n\nMeanwhile, a homesick Chino in America finds comfort in his newfound friend, Gwen (Heart Evangelista). With Gwen\u2019s attributes, Chino falls for Gwen in no time. One night, Chino receives a phone call from Sammy asking him to come back to Manila to meet his new sister-in-law. Chino, together with Gwen, excitedly heads back to Manila to be introduced to the new bride. Chino\u2019s excitement turns into despair when he realizes that his new sister-in-law turns out to be Lani, the girl he abandoned.\n\nUnable to confess to Sammy and Gwen, Chino\u2019s paranoia and Lani\u2019s constant seduction create a rift between the two brothers. Little did Sammy and Chino know, the plot has been carefully planned by Lani and Gwen. Gwen is actually Lani\u2019s long-lost sister who was adopted by a Filipino family in America. Gwen, who is trying to make up for their years apart, agrees to Lani\u2019s plot. The pact between the two sisters becomes complicated, however, when Gwen slowly falls for Chino.\n\nLani feels betrayed by Gwen\u2019s feelings for Chino, and promises to win Chino back. Lani succeeds. Sammy discovers the infidelity of his wife . Sammy\u2019s violent streak surfaces as his jealousy turns to rage. He soon discovers the connivance of the sisters and takes Lani to a remote cabin to kill her.\n\nGwen learns from their mother about Lani\u2019s miscarriage. She decides to tell Chino about Lani\u2019s misfortune together with her secret as Lani\u2019s long-lost sister. Realizing the absence of Sammy and Lani in the house, Chino and Gwen seek help from Sammy\u2019s ex-wife. After they obtained vital information about the whereabouts of Sammy and Lani, Chino and Gwen head to the cabin to save Lani. Gwen and Chino find the cabin as Sammy is torturing Lani. Chino and Sammy wrestle for the gun. The unthinkable happens. Chino kills Sammy.\n\nChino faces trial and is found innocent. As he comes out of prison, Gwen waits for him. While Chino and Gwen start their new lives, Lani, who now inherits Sammy\u2019s fortune, finally fulfills her American dream",
