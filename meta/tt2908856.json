  "overview": "Mathias Gold (Kevin Kline) is a down-on-his-luck New Yorker who inherits a Parisian apartment from his estranged father. But when he arrives in France to sell the vast domicile, he's shocked to discover a live-in tenant who is not prepared to budge. His apartment is a viager - an ancient French real estate system with complex rules pertaining to its resale - and the feisty Englishwoman Mathilde Girard (Maggie Smith), who has lived in the apartment with her daughter Chlo\u00e9 (Kristin Scott Thomas) for many years, can by contract collect monthly payments from Mathias until her death.",
  "storyline": "Mathias, a penniless fifty-odd-year-old New Yorker, lands in Paris. Both cynical and at the end of his tether, he looks forward to selling the mansion house his late father owned in the Marais district. But what he finds out there just appalls him: his secretive dad had never told him he had acquired the property as a life lease, a typically French custom he never heard of. As a consequence, not only will poor Mathias be unable to sell the house into cash (at least as long as Mathilde stays alive) but he will have to pay the old lady a pension into the bargain...!",
  "plot": "Mathias, a down-and-out New Yorker, travels to Paris to sell a large, valuable apartment he has inherited from his estranged father. Once there, however, he discovers an old woman, Mathilde, living in the apartment with her daughter Chlo\u00e9.\n\nMathias quickly learns that the apartment is a \"viager\" \u2014 an ancient French system for buying and selling apartments \u2014 and that he will not actually get possession of the apartment until Mathilde dies and that he owes her a life annuity of \u20ac2400 a month. All this is a surprise to him since his father never told him and Mathias had language problems with the French lawyer.\n\nMathias has no money and no place to live, but Mathilde allows him to stay in the apartment with her if he pays rent. However, to pay for the next life annuity payment, he steals and sells furniture from the apartment and asks a prospective buyer of his contract for an advance payment.\n\nMathias discovers that Mathilde and his father had a long-lasting affair while both were married. Mathias and Chlo\u00e9 fall in love with each other after emotionally bonding about their childhood. Since Chlo\u00e9 wants to stay in the apartment, Mathias decides at the last minute to decline a multimillion offer for the apartment/contract. Mathilde points out that Mathias does not have to worry about money: he can sell en viager, allowing him to live in the apartment while also providing him a life annuity, albeit a modest one because of his relatively young age of 57.",
