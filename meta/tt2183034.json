  "overview": "After a construction project begins digging in their neighborhood, best friends Tuck, Munch and Alex inexplicably begin to receive strange, encoded messages on their cell phones. Convinced something bigger is going on, they go to their parents and the authorities. When everyone around them refuses to take the messages seriously, the three embark on a secret adventure to crack the code and follow it to its source. But taking matters into their own hands gets the trio in way over their heads when they discover a mysterious being from another world who desperately needs their help. The epic, suspenseful and exciting journey that follows will change all of their lives forever.",
  "storyline": "\"Earth to Echo\" follows four young teenagers who find an alien life form that's trying to rebuild its spaceship. Together, the teenagers protect the alien and help rebuild its ship so it can fly back to its home planet.",
  "plot": "Three neighborhood teens and childhood friends, Alex, Tuck, and Munch, are upset by the fact that their neighborhood, Mulberry Woods, Nevada, is being demolished, allegedly for a new highway construction project, and that Alex is moving, due to him being a foster child.\n\nWhile at Tuck's house, their phones start to glitch out, displaying seemingly random graphical patterns. They soon find out, through Munch, that the patterns are actually a map to a spot in the desert 17.6 miles away. They decide to go to the desert on their bikes and disguise it as a sleepover, recording the experience on various cameras because it's their last night together.\n\nTuck, Alex, and Munch soon make it to the desert, as they follow the map to a dusty, rusted object under a cable tower. Tuck, confused, decides to abruptly call it off, when the object starts to copy Alex's ringtone. They follow another map to a barn, as the object telekinetically starts to repair itself, and is able to answer questions using a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer, from which the boys learn that it is from outer space, has crash landed, and was seriously injured.\n\nThey soon follow another map to a pawn shop, where the object further repairs itself, and reveals itself as an alien, using Alex's phone camera to \"see\" and befriend the three. While in an alley, they decide to name the alien \"Echo.\" They again follow another map to a house in which Emma, a Mulberry Woods high school student, lives and finds out about Echo. Emma soon joins the team, as they go to a bar, and then an arcade, as she finds out the object Echo is in is a key to a spaceship hidden in Mulberry Woods.\n\nAt the arcade, Alex is caught by a security guard. Although Tuck and Munch suspect Alex allowed himself to be caught because he is angry at Tuck for accidentally abandoning him, Emma goes back in to rescue Alex, and Echo scares the security guard away. Stopping at a nearby restaurant, the four talk and reconcile, as a \"construction worker\" captures both Munch and Echo. Tuck, Alex, and Emma then go to Tuck's brother's party and steal his car to catch up with Munch and Echo. They find the \"construction site\" where Munch is being interrogated and Echo is being experimented on, but get caught by the same \"construction worker.\" He explains that he and his group (who seem to actually be government agents of some kind) shot down Echo's spaceship and intend to prevent him from repairing it and going home so they can capture and study Echo's technology. However, right after they shot it down they discovered they couldn't find any debris from the spaceship, so they invented a false construction project so they could dig up the neighborhood, thinking it must have somehow concealed itself underground.\n\nAfter the kids lie and say they'll help them find Echo's spaceship, the agents take the four kids to a junkyard, where Echo seemingly dies as a result of the experimentation, but with encouragement from the kids he revives and completes his repairs, then diverts and traps the agents long enough for the four kids to drive back home and find the core of the spaceship, which was buried under Alex's home the entire time. Alex takes Echo inside, followed by the rest of them, where they say goodbye as Echo safely starts up the ship, telekinetically reassembles it from parts that had been buried all over the neighborhood, and flies away.\n\nAfter the event, the construction project is abandoned, but Alex and Munch move away anyway, as their families had already bought new homes elsewhere. Tuck stays, however, and new neighbors move in. Sometime later, the four meet up again, as the film ends with Alex holding up his phone towards the sky.\n\nIn a scene after the credits, Alex addresses his friends as his phone apparently starts to move and glitch out, a sign that Echo may be returning.",
  "synopsis": "Tuck, Munch and Alex are a trio of inseparable friends whose lives are about to change. Their neighbourhood is being destroyed by a highway construction project that is forcing their families to move away. But just two days before they must part ways, the boys begin receiving a strange series of signals on their phones. Convinced something bigger is going on, they team up with another school friend, Emma, and set out to look for the source of their phone signals. What they discover is something beyond their wildest imaginations: a small alien who has become stranded on Earth. In need of their help, the four friends come together to protect the alien and help him find his way home. This journey, full of wonder and adventure, is their story, and their secret."
