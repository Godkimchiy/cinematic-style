  "plot": "Susanne is the owner of a model agency in Stockholm. Doris, her most popular model, has an argument with her fianc\u00e9, Palle, just before she goes with Susanne to Gothenburg to be photographed in a new collection.\n\nIn Gothenburg Doris meets an aging Consul, who sees in her a striking resemblance to his wife, now in a mental hospital. The Consul gratifies Doris\u2019s desires for fine clothes and jewelry, and the two spend a strenuously exciting day together, until his daughter arrives and ruthlessly exposes her father\u2019s egotism.\n\nSusanne has meanwhile telephoned her ex-lover Henrik and arranged a rendezvous with him. Henrik reluctantly visits her. They make love and are planning to resume their relationship when his wife arrives.\n\nShe proves conclusively that Henrik is a weakling. Disillusioned, Susanne returns with Doris to Stockholm, where Doris\u2019s fianc\u00e9 waits.",
