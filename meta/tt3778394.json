  "plot": "A group of 3 friends try to earn a lot of money quickly. After considering several options, they try to make a short film. They manage to get in contact with the famous actor Ricardo Dar\u00edn (who plays himself in the movie), who mistook one of them as a relative of one of his friends, and agreed to work with them because of the misunderstanding. The group starts to film, and attempts to drive a car slowly towards Dar\u00edn while filming; but the untrained driver accelerated instead of stopping the car, and killed him.\n\nThe three friends escaped, and all the media was filled with people asking for the whereabouts of Dar\u00edn. They arranged some portions of the unreleased short film to make it seem as if Dar\u00edn was leaving the country, which led to a national outrage. They tried to use a similar system to stage a request of a million dollars to the producers of his last film; those producers denounced that Dar\u00edn had been kidnapped. This led to a complete national crisis, and the US threatened to start bombing Buenos Aires if Dar\u00edn did not appear alive.",
