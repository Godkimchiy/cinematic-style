  "overview": "A film about the black-and-white era actress L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1 and her doomed love affair.",
  "storyline": "One of the greatest untold love stories of the 20th century, this is the story of L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1, a beautiful Czech actress, who conquered Germany's silver screen as well as the heart of one of the Third Reich's most powerful men: the Minister of Propaganda, Joseph Goebbels. How could Hitler's chief ideologist fall in love with a non-Aryan Slavonic beauty whose race had been designated as inferior by the F\u00fchrer in \"Mein Kampf\" and whose country was soon to be occupied by the Nazis? How could one of Europe's most glamorous actresses reject offers of stardom from Hollywood in preference to a dangerous romance with the Nazi monster with a deformed leg?",
