Bone cancer claimed Jarem Frye's left leg at the age of 14. While the three are linked by what they are missing, it is their shared passion for climbing that pushed them towards an improbable goal - the first all-disabled ascent of Yosemite's iconic El Capitan.",

Bone cancer claimed Jarem Frye's left leg at the age of 14. While the three are linked by what they are missing, it is their shared passion for climbing that pushed them towards an improbable goal - the first all-disabled ascent of Yosemite's iconic El Capitan. There was no cause. No call for awareness. No fund raising. \"We are climbers first, disabled second,\" says DeMartino. \"If you're a climber, you want to climb El Cap.\" The Gimp Monkeys follows their successful ascent of Zodiac, a 1,800-foot route on the Southeast Face of El Capitan.",
