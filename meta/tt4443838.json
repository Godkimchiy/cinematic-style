  "overview": "Witty banter abounds between two early 20-something sisters who tease each other almost as much as they need each other. Elle and Joy spend their last week before their next music tour wandering through the heart of Laurel Canyon, whiling away carefree afternoons with their friends as they plan for their own going away party. Real-life sisters Aly and AJ Michalka show off their musical talents and unapologetically neurotic and wry sense of humor. In his directorial debut, Stephen Ringer reveals a clear affection for the film\u2019s starlets, capturing quotidian hilarities while keeping real the depths of a powerful bond between sisters.",
  "storyline": "Two sisters on the cusp of adulthood, Elle and Joy, spend a final week before embarking on their next music tour visiting friends and preparing for the going away party they intend to host. Their apprehensions about throwing the party are universally validated when their divorced mother and father, as well as both of their ex-girlfriends, converge on the party, leaving tragedy in the wake of what they had envisioned as a unifying celebration. In the aftermath of this fateful night, Elle and Joy are left with the sobering yet liberating truth that they can only rely on each other.",
