  "plot": "In Las Vegas, vice LVMPD policemen Vincent Downs and Sean Cass rob a shipment of cocaine belonging to entrepreneur Stanley Rubino, who is associated with mobster Rob Novak, the son of a powerful mob boss. They volunteer to investigate the robbery in order to cover up their involvement, clashing with Internal Affairs investigators Jennifer Bryant and Doug Dennison, who are suspicious of their involvement. Unbeknownst to them, Vincent is undercover on behalf of Internal Affairs to dismantle the crime ring within the police department, which has left him estranged from his ex-wife Dena and their son, Thomas.\n\nWhile driving Thomas to soccer practice, Vincent is ambushed by Rubino's men, who stab him in the abdomen and kidnap Thomas, demanding the stolen cocaine back in exchange for Thomas's life. Vincent retrieves the cocaine from Cass, places it in a duffel bag and leaves it in the ventilation shaft of one of the bathrooms in Rubino's casino, but is unknowingly followed by Bryant, who hides it in the women's locker room nearby. Upon learning that the drugs were moved, Vincent is forced to present Rubino with a bag of sugar to ensure Thomas's safety, but Novak uncovers his ruse and Thomas is recaptured by Rubino's men, while Vincent manages to escape.\n\nVincent infiltrates the casino disguised as a security guard, but is located by Bryant and chased into one of the hotel rooms, where he subdues her and reveals he's working for Internal Affairs. Bryant directs him to the locker room, but the drugs have disappeared. Dennison ambushes Vincent, but is ultimately overpowered and knocked unconscious, while Thomas manages to escape, stealing Rubino's cellphone to contact Vincent. Elsewhere, Dena finds out Vincent and Thomas are in danger and heads to the casino as well.\n\nCass arrives and saves Vincent from Novak's men, but is shot in the process and presumed dead. Going through Cass' phone, Vincent finds out Dennison is on Novak's payroll and informed Cass that Vincent was Internal Affairs and needed to be killed. Bryant and Dennison later find a severely injured Cass in the garage. Dennison privately questions Cass on whether Vincent is aware of his involvement and finishes him off when Cass refuses to answer. Vincent and Thomas reunite just as Novak begins shooting up the casino and escape to the parking garage. Meanwhile, Bryant arrests Rubino.\n\nVincent and Thomas attempt to escape in a stolen car, but are ambushed by Novak and his men, leading to a violent shootout. Dena arrives and kills some of Novak's men before Novak corners them. He shoots Vincent in the chest, but Vincent survives and fatally shoots Novak. Vincent then contacts Bryant and alerts her of Dennison's corruption. Realizing he's been exposed, Dennison draws his gun, and shoots Bryant and Rubino and forces the police cruiser they're in to crash.\n\nDennison crawls out of the wreckage claiming Rubino killed Bryant and the driver with a stolen gun before being shot by Dennison, but Bryant has managed to survive and exposes Dennison, who is arrested by the arriving policemen. Vincent and Bryant are taken to the same hospital, where they make ammends and congratulate each other on the job. Meanwhile, a corrupt DEA Agent contacts Novak's father and informs him there's been a problem.",
  "synopsis": "Two men in masks are chasing after a van. They hit the van and cause it to crash. The men are really cops - Vincent Downs (Jamie Foxx) and Sean Cass (T.I.).
