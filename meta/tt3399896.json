  "storyline": "Following a near-fatal accident, David Chamberlain makes an unprecedented discovery that will not only determine the fate of his family, but of mankind.",
  "plot": "Reports of a downed extraterrestrial object bring the attention of U.S. government agents. Although disappointed that they find no living specimens, the agents take an eyewitness into custody to observe him after they find he is no longer blind. Elsewhere, David Chamberlain, a mechanic who has not recovered from the death of his wife Jane, struggles to keep his job. Zach, a veteran of a war currently ongoing in Iran, asks for a job, though David must turn him down. David later helps Zach in a bar fight, learning that Zach is missing a leg. When David returns home, his daughter Annabelle tells him that his last two payments failed to go through, and she has been forced to return home from college.\n\nUpset, David takes a car ride and crashes after seeing an object streak down from the sky. When David fails to return home to next morning, Annabelle looks for him. She finds him wandering near his crashed car and takes him to the hospital. A doctor informs Annabelle that David inexplicably has a kidney that was removed in a vain attempt to save his wife. Now obsessed with the object, David becomes convinced it is giving him instructions through his dead wife. Meanwhile, the agents supervise surgery on the eyewitness and argue with their supervisor to continue their research. He says the continuing war in Iran is necessary to raise the country's morale and takes precedence over any possible evidence of extraterrestrial contact.\n\nDavid hires Zach to help him retrieve the object. As they do so, Zach touches it and becomes unnerved by the feedback. While protesting the advancing war amid reports that Russia, China, and France have threatened retaliation against the U.S. push into Iran, Zach experiences pain in his amputated leg. When he realizes that his leg is slowly regrowing, he returns to David to demand an explanation. David tells Annabelle and Zach about the object and insists that Zach must be brought into proximity with it. Zach's leg rapidly regenerates, causing him to join David's quest to create a large structure David believes the object wants built. They steal materials from a local junkyard, putting everything in an abandoned factory.\n\nThe agents, lured by reports of unexplained regeneration, come to David's house. Though David initially denies any knowledge, when they confront him with the hospital records, he says the object melted. Disbelieving him, the agents tail David, only to lose him when his friend Tony Cerillo helps. As the conflict in Iran escalates, David comes to believe the structure will save Annabelle from the oncoming nuclear war. When Cerillo investigates the missing materials from the junkyard, he confronts David, who accidentally kills him. Filled with remorse, David confides to Jane that he believes himself unworthy of the object, and she confirms that it was meant for others, whom David must assist.\n\nGovernment scientists inform the agents that the object is an example of abiogenesis. Frustrated with delays, the agents return to David's house, where they take Zach and Annabelle hostage. David rescues them as they begin torturing Zach. As they escape, Agent Stipe shoots Annabelle, knowing David will return to the object to heal her. There, Agent Stipe shoots David. His subordinate, Agent Lubinski, objects, saying that the object should not be used to further the war effort. Zach, Stipe, and Lubinski engage in a firefight, and all are wounded. David helps Zach and Annabelle into the structure, apologizes for not being able to join them, and seals them in it just as a nuclear war begins. When Zach and Annabelle emerge, the world is in ruins.",
