When a heist taking place in the same building goes wrong, Pippa's home is broken into by the charismatic Kayleigh. Pippa is taken hostage by this unpredictable and volatile thief who's looking for a temporary hideout, but when outside forces close in, Kayleigh takes a darker path to get her way. As the confined space becomes a fighting ring, in a tense struggle to get out Pippa learns how to stand up for herself once again.",
  "storyline": "Confine, a taut psychological thriller, stars Daisy Lowe in her first lead role as the troubled former model Pippa, who hasn't dared leave her London apartment in four years. Pippa's refuge is violently invaded when an armed thief, Kayleigh (Eliza Bennett), breaks in and takes Pippa hostage. Alfie Allen (Game of Thrones), plays Kayleigh's increasingly hapless partner-in-crime who soon realises he is way out of his depth.",
