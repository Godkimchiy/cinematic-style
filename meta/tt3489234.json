  "overview": "Love &amp; Engineering is for everyone who has experienced uncertainty, had a crush on someone or been on a date. The film asks what are our so-called \u201cfeelings\u201d and can we can control them or not. Challenges of the dating world are approached through the perspective of male engineers: how to encounter people in the real world? The film reveals that falling in love happens in three phases and that charming your date could be just a matter of adept hacking skills!",
  "storyline": "Our modern life is largely designed by engineers. They like to invent and structure things and they are more at ease with figures and natural science than in relations with the opposite sex. Atanas, a Bulgarian computer engineer claims to have hacked love, but can he help lonely and shy engineers find real love and real happiness? As he tries to develop a scientific formula for the perfect relationship, he uses other engineers as his guinea pigs; teaches them his ideas and sends them out to test them in the real world. He guides his subjects with wireless transmitters during their set up meetings with potential candidates: beautiful young women. Are the rules of attraction, sex and love scientific and if they are, do we really want to know them?",
