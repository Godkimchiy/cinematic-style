  "plot": "Firmly in the tradition of American Westerns, it follows the lives of the two orphaned brothers. The older one, Buddy, sees his father being shot. Vulnerable and described as \u201cslow\u201d, Buddy gets co-opted by gangster Julius Hench (Vincent D\u2019Onofrio) and turns into his key assassin. While Buddy grows up in a lawless environment, younger brother Jakey is a violinist auditioning for the New York Philharmonic and on the verge of marrying his Portuguese girlfriend. But first Jakey must return to his dusty home town near the U.S.\u2013Mexican border to receive his wedding present from his older brother. Returning to that one-horse town opens up unhealed wounds and forces Jakey and Buddy to confront some ugly truths.\n\nHench won\u2019t let Buddy quit the job. He will do anything to keep his most efficient, easily manipulated killing machine on his rolls, including bumping off Jakey. When Jakey realizes what Buddy is up against, he orchestrates a rather poorly designed plan to help them both escape from Hench.",
  "synopsis": "When concert-level violinist Jake Heckum returns to his rural Western town to visit his simple-minded brother Buddy, he learns that Buddy has fallen under the influence of murderous ganglord, Hench, who has turned the gullible Buddy into a killing machine. Now, Buddy wants to quit the gang and join Jake in New York , but Hench has no intention of letting his prize hit-man go so easily"
