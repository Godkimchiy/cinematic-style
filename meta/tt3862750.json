Enter Carter Duncan, a handsome, charming stranger whose path keeps crossing with Leah's. Caring and solicitous of Leah and her family and friends, their relationship rapidly progresses. It seems Leah has met the perfect guy. But if it seems too good to be true... Soon Carter's protective nature morphs into something more sinister. It's clear Leah has to end this new relationship and when she does, her onetime lover becomes her ultimate enemy. It will take every bit of her cunning and resolve to escape and outwit him.",
  "storyline": "After a painful breakup, successful lobbyist Leah Vaughn (Sanaa Lathan) jumps into a passionate relationship with a charming stranger (Michael Ealy). When her ex-boyfriend (Morris Chestnut) resurfaces in her life she has to figure out who she should trust and who she should fear.",
  "plot": "Successful lobbyist Leah Vaughn (Sanaa Lathan) is unhappy in her relationship with her boyfriend Dave King (Morris Chestnut), who refuses to commit to her wishes of starting a family, causing them to break up. Two months later, she meets the charming Carter Duncan (Michael Ealy), who works in IT for another company. They quickly grow close and he works his way into the hearts of her friends as well as her mother and father. On their way home from a trip to San Francisco to meet her parents, a stranger at a gas station asks Leah about Carter's Dodge Charger. Carter viciously attacks the man before Carter and a mortified Leah drives off when the station's owner orders them to leave. Distraught over his actions, Leah decides to break up with him that night.\n\nOver the next several weeks, Carter stalks Leah at her job and makes numerous phone calls, even after she changes her phone number. Unbeknownst to her, he also intrudes into her house with her spare house key, feeling around her belongings, hacking into her computer and abducting her cat. She finally decides to go to the police, meeting with Detective Hansen (Holt McCallany) who advises her to keep note of any further attempts Carter makes to contact her. Leah later finds a threatening note and a single red rose attached to her car and files a restraining order against Carter, causing him to lose his job. Some time later, Dave contacts Leah about rekindling their relationship and Leah eagerly agrees. One night, Leah and Dave find Carter watching them at a restaurant, and Dave grimly warns him to stay away. They still notify the police and, after Hansen interrogates Carter over the violation, Carter feigns innocence, stating he had no idea she was there and that Dave was aggressive towards him. Hansen lets him go.\n\nOne night, Leah's neighbour, Mrs. McCarthy (Tess Harper), discovers Carter inside Leah's house, and Carter pushes her down the stairs, killing her. Carter secretly videotapes Leah and Dave as they sleep and make love and uses Leah's work email account to send the video to her co-workers and her business's clients, causing her to be suspended from her job. Carter also sabotages Dave's car, causing it to crash, and suffocates the injured Dave.\n\nBoth Leah and Hansen are certain that Carter is involved in Dave's death, though they lack the evidence necessary to incriminate him. After investigating further, Hansen learns that Carter's real name is Robert Adams, and that he changed his identity after a similar series of harassment. He subtly tells Leah to take care of him on her own if necessary, leading her to buy a shotgun and shells. Leah discovers Robert, with a new identity, with another woman. She frightens her off and files another restraining order against him in front his new employers, once again getting him fired. She then manages to find a hideout of his where he monitors her, as well as finding her cat. She destroys his numerous computers and leaves, daring him to come after her again.\n\nThat night, Robert breaks into Leah's home and, after luring him to an empty room, she aims her gun at him. After managing to knock the gun out of her hand, a struggle ensues, which ends with her shooting him twice with bean bag rounds in an attempt to immobilize him. After he continues to advance, she shoots him with a real bullet and kills him. A now relieved Leah reports Robert to Hansen as an intruder, and police cart his corpse out of her house.",

Before he leaves, Hansen gets physical with Carter and tells him he should be more careful.One night, while Carter is installing cameras inside Leah's house, her neighbor, Mrs. McCarthy walks in and asks what he's doing. He says Leah asked him to come and check on some things, but Mrs. McCarthy says she thought they'd broken up. As he approaches her menacingly, she runs back to her home with Carter hot on her heels. She manages to lock the front door, but Carter grabs her from behind. They struggle toward the basement, and Carter kills her by pushing her down the stairs, causing her to break her neck.A week later, the body is discovered when Mrs. McCarthy's daughter calls the police.

The most disturbing of all is while they are making love, Carter is under Leah's bed listening.The next day at work, Leah's bosses advises her an email containing a video of her and Dave having sex was sent to all the employees and business associates. Leah pleads with her boss, but he suspends her anyway.While in bed, Leah gives Dave a birthday present purchased before their breakup. Its a watch engraved with I will always love you, Leah. Dave says he will never take it off. The next day Dace has a business meeting in Santa Barbara and while there, Carter sabotages David's car by loosening all the lug nuts on his tire. While driving the curved hills, Dace loses control of the car as the wheel loosens, causing it to flip down a hill and seriously injure him. Carter has been closely following him and after the wreck, he goes down to the wreckage and kills the Dave by suffocating him. He also removes Dave's watch.Meanwhile, Leah has been frantically calling Dave, and she falls asleep waiting for him. Hansen and another detective arrive at Leah's home to tell her of Dave's death. Leah collapses in his arms.After the funeral, Leah returns home and falls asleep fully dressed. When she awakens, Dave's watch is on the nightstand.Leah is convinced Carter is involved, but there are no prints anywhere, and Hansen advises her there is no evidence proving otherwise. After investigating Carter, Hansen has learned that Carter is not his real name, and that he changed his identity after a similar series of harassment. He also tells Leah that Carter was shuffled from foster home to foster home and everything he told her is a lie.He tells Leah its his coffee break, and she is furious. She follows him to a coffee shop where he tells her a story about a person who kept getting robbed. This guy bought a 12 gauge shotgun and put two bean packs in the first rounds and shells in the remaining rounds. When she asks why, he tells her the first two are a warning. He tells her she may be forced to take care of him on her own. We then see Leah buying a shotgun.Leah spots Carter with another woman and approaches the couple. She tells the woman everything Carter has done to her and advises her to run and run fast, which the woman does. Leah then files another restraining order against him and delivers it to his new boss herself, again getting him fired. Furious, Carter kicks the trash can as he's leaving his office.While following him, she finds his apartment and breaks in using a crowbar. There she finds all his computer monitors as well as her cat. Unable to crack the password, using a bat, she destroys all his computers and trashes the apartment. She then spray paints, Not good enough bring it bitch on the wall.That night, Carter breaks into Leah's home. He hears the shower running and enters the bathroom. The steam makes it impossible to see into the shower stall, but Carter hears the shotgun cock behind him. He turns to see Leah aiming the gun at him. Hesitating to shoot, Carter manages to get the gun away from Leah. The two fight and Carter slings Leah from room to room against the walls. He throws her down the stairs, and the two continue the fight in the kitchen. Leah is able to grab a knife and slash Carter once before he gets the knife away. Using pots on the stove, Leah finally incapacitates him enough to grab the shotgun. Carter dares her to shoot him and continues to advance; Leah shoots him with the bean-bag ammo twice in an attempt to immobilize him. When he asks her what that was, she says a warning. As he continues to advance, she shoots him with an actual shell, killing him sending him crashing back and shattering the glass top coffee table.A beaten and bloodied Leah enters the police department asking for Hansen. She lays the gun on his desk and says \"I'd like to report an intruder\". The last scene is the police removing Carter's body from Leah's home."
