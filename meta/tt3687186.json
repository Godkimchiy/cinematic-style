  "overview": "A young heroin addict roams the streets of New York to panhandle and get her next fix, while her unstable boyfriend drifts in and out of her life at random.",
  "storyline": "A young woman struggles to reconcile her loves of her life; her boyfriend and heroin. She finds out that suicide is the only way for her boyfriend to forgive her for her misdeed.",
  "plot": "Harley (Arielle Holmes), a homeless girl in New York City, loves Ilya (Caleb Landry Jones). He gives her life purpose and sets her passion ablaze. So, when he asks her to prove her love by slitting her wrists, she obliges with only mild hesitation, perhaps because of her other all-consuming love: heroin. After the attempted suicide, she is taken to hospital.\n\nHarley leaves the psychiatric hospital and meets her friend Skully (Ron Braunstein). Skully tries to persuade Harley to break up with Ilya, but Harley doesn't listen to Skully. Harley goes meet a drug dealer Mike (Buddy Duress) and gets some drugs. Angry with Harley's attitude, Skully has a quarrel with her and goes away.\n\nAfter spending a night with Mike, Harley starts living together with him. She makes a living by begging, shoplifting, and stealing. Some weeks later, Harley meets Ilya again. Mike fights a duel with Ilya at the park and gets injured. Treating his wound, Harley tells Mike that she still loves Ilya.\n\nOne night, Harley receives a phone call from one of her friends and goes to a fast-food restaurant. There, Ilya lies unconscious of a drug overdose at the restroom. Harley practices artificial respiration on Ilya, and Ilya comes back to life.\n\nFalling in love again, Harley and Ilya get on the bus bound for Miami. While Harley is sleeping, Ilya gets off the bus alone and enters a vacant house. At night, the candle near his bed causes a fire, and Ilya is enveloped in flames.\n\nHarley wakes up at the bus and notices that Ilya is not there. Confused, she gets off the bus and goes back to New York City. She enters a fast-food restaurant, where Mike boasts his friends about his story. From a distant seat, Harley watches them in silence.",
