  "overview": "In a small village in the hinterland, three stories of love and desire are changing the emotional landscape of its residents. Characters of a romanesque world in which their conceptions of life are limited on one side by human instincts, on the other by a blind and fatalist fate.",
  "storyline": "The History of Eternity is a synesthetic essay about love, desires and dreams. The entire narrative takes place in the same village with approximately 40 inhabitants in a desert landscape, a geographical point in northeastern Brazil with specific references in relation to time and space. A secluded place where everything happens at a measured pace, inspiring extremely visceral moments within the cycle that repeats itself eternally on the stage of human tragedy.",
