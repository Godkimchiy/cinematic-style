  "overview": "Serge Tanneur (Fabrice Luchini) is at the pinnacle of his acting career when he decides to turn his back on show business and become a hermit living off of France\u2019s Atlantic coast. Three years later, Gauthier Valence (Lambert Wilson), a beloved TV actor, shows up on the island to offer Serge a role in his directorial debut \u2013 a rendition of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s classic play, \u201cThe Misanthrope\u201d. Serge refuses at first, but then suggests that they rehearse the first scene and after five days he\u2019ll decide if he wants to dothe play or not. What ensues is a battle of brawn and wits and peculiar encounters with a hotel maid who longs to be a pornstar and an Italian divorc\u00e9e.",

Fellow actor Gauthier Valence (Lambert Wilson), whose career is flying high, is planning a production of Moli\u00e8re's play The Misanthrope and wants to offer Serge the role of Filinte. Gauthier is convinced he will accept, since Serge himself has become a misanthrope, withdrawn from society and raging against the world. It would be wonderful to see him return in that part. But Serge plays hard to get, first of all as he want to play the title role. Instead of committing, he suggests they rehearse together for the week.
