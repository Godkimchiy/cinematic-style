  "overview": "A teenager overcomes odds to run a 4-minute mile race.",
  "storyline": "The life of a disenfranchised teen living on the wrong side of the tracks, desperate for a way out, collides with an old reclusive track coach, angry at the world and with no purpose in life, with whom he eventually forms a bond. The two are forced to face their circumstances as they race to save each other and, ultimately, themselves.",
  "plot": "A teen track runner Drew (Kelly Blatz) is struggling on the track as well as at home. He accepts an offer from his reclusive neighbor (Richard Jenkins) to train him and the two form a bond.\n\nThe movie 4 Minute Mile tells the inspirational story of Drew, a high school student struggling to overcome the inner-city surroundings that threaten to imprison him. After getting manipulated into running drug payments to a local dealer, Drew has nowhere to turn in a family with a deadbeat older brother and an overwhelmed single mom.\n\nHis only outlet is track practice, but that is taken from him as he continues down the path of his sibling; even the affections of a girl at school can\u2019t set him straight.\n\nJust as it seems hopeless, an ex-track coach with his own demons witnesses Drew\u2019s speed and athleticism and decides to train him to reach for more than he ever imagined possible. Together they work towards finding solace in each other, but Drew\u2019s resolve is threatened as tragedy strikes right before the biggest race of his life and forces him to confront everything that has been holding him back.",
