  "plot": "In the remote Icelandic valley, there is not much to do other than observe the horses, the neighbors, and the neighbors' horses with binoculars. Undisturbed, the stallions and mares do what nobody else in the valley dares to even talk about: love. However, there is still a feeling of love among some of the valley dwellers. Kolbeinn (Ingvar Eggert Sigur\u00f0sson) and Solveig's (Charlotte B\u00f8ving) attempts at love are the subject of much interest for the valley dwellers.\n\nMeanwhile, Vernhardur (Steinn \u00c1rmann Magn\u00fasson), who has a weakness for liquor, makes a name for himself on a Russian fishing vessel with the sailor Gengis (Kash Erden Baater). There is often disagreement about the riding routes between Grimur (Kjartan Ragnarsson) and Egill (Helgi Bj\u00f6rnsson); Grimur generally prefers the classic routes on horseback, whereas Egill prefers riding through rough terrain on his tractor. J\u00f3hanna (Sigr\u00ed\u00f0ur Mar\u00eda Egilsd\u00f3ttir), on the other hand, has nothing to say concerning her mare Raudka. One day, she encounters an injured old man. The religious Juan Camillo (himself) is seeking God on a high spiritual level.\n\nAbove all, all the people in the valley share a love of their horses, and eventually come to understand one another.",
