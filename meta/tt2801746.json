  "storyline": "Martin seeks for a temporary job at Eugenio's house. When they recognize to be childhood friends, Eugenio offers him work for the summer. A power and desire game starts and their relationship grows beyond their friendship.",
  "plot": "Mart\u00edn (Mateo Chiarino), an orphan, arrives at his former hometown hoping to stay with his aunt after his grandmother had died. He finds out that his aunt had moved without leaving a forwarding address. With no place to stay and little money, he beds down behind the ruins of an abandoned building. He looks around for odd jobs and is eventually hired by the writer Eugenio (Manuel Vignau), a former childhood playmate. Mart\u00edn does not want to admit that he is homeless, and lies to Eugenio that he is staying with his aunt. Eugenio eventually finds out about Mart\u00edn's situation and convinces Mart\u00edn to stay at his house for the summer.\n\nAt first Eugenio does not seemingly remember much about Mart\u00edn, but little by little they start to recall their shared memories as children. Eugenio realizes his growing attraction to Mart\u00edn but is reluctant to pursue it, as he does not want to seem to be taking advantage of Mart\u00edn's current financial situation. He is also afraid that even if the soft-spoken Mart\u00edn might reciprocate his feelings, it might only be because Mart\u00edn feels indebted to him. Mart\u00edn himself is attracted to Eugenio, but he does not know if Eugenio is gay. And given his impoverished background, he does not want to presume on Eugenio's kindness.\n\nNonetheless, Eugenio and Mart\u00edn slowly grow closer together, and Eugenio finds it becoming increasingly difficult to hide his attraction. One day while moving some furniture, Eugenio accidentally knocks over some drawings of naked men from his desk. Mart\u00edn sees the drawings, but Eugenio pointedly avoids talking about it. It dawns on Mart\u00edn that Eugenio might be attracted to him. Mart\u00edn confirms his suspicions when he sees Eugenio's flustered reaction after he deliberately strips in front of Eugenio one night with the excuse of doing laundry.\n\nMart\u00edn kisses Eugenio the next morning, confident that Eugenio is also attracted to him. But Eugenio unexpectedly rebuffs him, and Mart\u00edn leaves confused. That afternoon, Eugenio discovers that Mart\u00edn had packed up and left. He searches for him for several days but is unable to find him. Eugenio remembers Mart\u00edn reminiscing about \"dos anan\u00e1s\" (\"two pineapples\"). He realizes that Mart\u00edn was talking about a picture from a Hawaii reel that they used to look at on a View-Master as children. He looks for the reel and the old View-Master and leaves them behind the abandoned building that Mart\u00edn used to stay at. A few days later, Mart\u00edn comes back, carrying the View-Master with him. They smile at each other and kiss.",
