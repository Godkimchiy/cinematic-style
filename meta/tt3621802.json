  "plot": "Inspector Ch\u00e1vez (Demi\u00e1n Bichir), a detective on the Buenos Aires police force, and his partner Dolores (M\u00f3nica Anton\u00f3pulos) are called one summer night to the Recoleta residence of Jaime Figueroa Alcorta (Mart\u00edn Wullich), a wealthy older gay member of Buenos Aires high society. At the scene, Ch\u00e1vez meets the young officer G\u00f3mez (Chino Dar\u00edn), who says that he found Alcorta's body after investigating a noise complaint and who has been examining the dead man's possessions. The next day, the two men encounter each other in the police station restroom, where G\u00f3mez shows Ch\u00e1vez a matchbook from the gay nightclub Manila that he accidentally took from the crime scene.\n\nDolores and Ch\u00e1vez head to Manila in search of \"Kevin,\" a lover of Alcorta who had left a message on the victim's answering machine. Ch\u00e1vez watches a flamboyant performance of a song he remembers from a record at the victim's apartment. He is approached by G\u00f3mez, claiming that he has also come to the club to investigate. Ch\u00e1vez angrily confronts G\u00f3mez, believing that the young man is following him, but accidentally starts a bar fight in the process, allowing the singer Kevin (Carlos Casella) to escape in the melee.\n\nG\u00f3mez joins Ch\u00e1vez on the homicide investigation, and they hatch a plan for G\u00f3mez to go undercover, using the younger man's good looks to get closer to Kevin. G\u00f3mez goes on a number of dates with Kevin, leading him to believe that Kevin is innocent. Meanwhile, Ch\u00e1vez, who is stuck in a passionless marriage, finds himself increasingly drawn to G\u00f3mez, though he does not acknowledge or act on his attraction. Ch\u00e1vez tries to call off the plan, thinking that G\u00f3mez is growing too fond of the suspect and questioning G\u00f3mez's sexuality; G\u00f3mez retorts by wondering if Ch\u00e1vez is becoming jealous. Later, Kevin takes G\u00f3mez to a room at Manila and they begin to have sex, but they are interrupted by Ch\u00e1vez and Dolores, who have been watching via hidden camera. Kevin is arrested and taken into custody.\n\nCh\u00e1vez goes to interrogate the incarcerated Kevin, who convinces Ch\u00e1vez to release him from prison temporarily. Kevin shows Ch\u00e1vez a herd of horses that he claims the Alcorta family use for drug smuggling. G\u00f3mez arrives on the scene and fatally shoots Kevin as he attempts to escape on horseback. Ch\u00e1vez again confronts G\u00f3mez, who claims that he was only trying to protect Ch\u00e1vez and that Kevin invented the smuggling story. When G\u00f3mez attempts to pull Ch\u00e1vez in for a kiss, Ch\u00e1vez reacts with a mixture of anger and desire, holding G\u00f3mez at gunpoint and forcing him against his car. Ch\u00e1vez begins to unbuckle his belt, but is interrupted by the arrival of police backup.\n\nThe city's criminal justice system moves to close the investigation under pressure from the Alcorta family. However, Ch\u00e1vez discovers that the horses were surgically implanted with drugs, matching Kevin's story. Ch\u00e1vez now believes that G\u00f3mez killed Jaime Figueroa Alcorta on behalf of the Alcorta family, who were angered by the dead man's opposition to the smuggling business. When Ch\u00e1vez confronts G\u00f3mez with his hypothesis, G\u00f3mez pleads innocence, and Ch\u00e1vez's paranoia reaches an extreme when he draws his gun on two policemen. Realizing his mistake, Ch\u00e1vez exclaims that he is going insane. G\u00f3mez comforts Ch\u00e1vez and begins to kiss him. After initially pulling back, Ch\u00e1vez returns the kiss passionately, but is soon stopped by a gunshot to the stomach, confirming his suspicions about G\u00f3mez. As he sinks to the ground, G\u00f3mez tells him that he will miss him. G\u00f3mez throws his gun into the river, smokes a cigarette, and walks off into the night.",
