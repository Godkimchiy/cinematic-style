But when the power is shut off and as it gets close to midnight, strange things start to happen.\n\nIt all starts with one death. Followed by another and another. They don\u2019t really witness the killings, but they hear the screaming, and they see the bloodied bodies thereafter, making them fear for their lives.\n\nAs the night unfolds, they soon realize they\u2019re not dealing with an ordinary being. There\u2019s an evil creature stuck inside the basement with them. But what kind of creature is this? And how can they fight it?",
