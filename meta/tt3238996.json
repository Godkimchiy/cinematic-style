  "overview": "A young man and young woman, both who have recently gone through break-ups, become friends over the festive season though don't wish to be each other's respective rebound. To get over this, the man goes on a series of disastrous dates so he can get together with the girl he really likes.",
  "storyline": "Two weeks before Christmas, Noel is left home alone in Porthcawl, a sleepy seaside town in\u00a0South Wales, and dumped by his long term girlfriend for another guy; a taller and more\u00a0rugged alternative. Faced with the unknown, he turns to primal scream therapy with his self-taught\u00a0therapist Simon and retreats to the past, reminiscing with his old school pal Steve. A\u00a0chance encounter with Cherie, a disillusioned actress who has returned home to reflect on her\u00a0past and present to begin a more fulfilled life, leads Noel to open up and share his passions. Their\u00a0shared love of music, eighties movies, and all things Christmas encourages a celebratory spirit, and the\u00a0possibility of a Happy New Year. Will the insecurities of recent break\u00adups, seasonal intoxication, and\u00a0mis\u00adcommunication conspire to ruin their fun or will they simply have a Wonderful Christmas Time?",
