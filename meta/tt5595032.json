  "overview": "The extraordinary true story of Barney Miller, an emerging Pro-surfer who became a quadriplegic 17 years ago. Told by doctors he would never use his legs again, Barney defied all medical assessments through grit, self-belief, hard work and sheer guts. When Barney meets and falls in love with Kate, a girl with her own dreams of being a singer, he makes it his mission to only ask Kate to marry him when he can kneel down to propose, stand at the altar and dance at their wedding together.",
  "storyline": "You and Me is a contemporary disability story about Barney Kate Miller who both had their life plans shattered. Kate is trying to escape a dark past in a search for true love. Barney is fighting to survive a personal tragedy that sent shock waves through the whole town, right when he was deciding the type of man was going to become. Together with the help of Mick Fanning they go on a heartfelt journey to redefine what it means to be a friend, a husband, a daughter and a person they both can be proud of, even when all the rules have been broken.",
