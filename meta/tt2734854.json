  "overview": "A boy and a girl wake up in bed one morning, naked. The children's mother died a few weeks earlier. Before she died she asked her children to find their birth father who left them when they were still babies. Their quest in search of their father leads them to hospitals, nursing homes and holding cells. In the course of the quest the brother and sister meet people who provide them - like in parallel quantum universes - a glance into what their future lives may hold for them.",

Their quest in search of their father leads them to hospitals, nursing homes and holding cells. In the course of the quest the brother and sister meet people who provide them - like in parallel quantum universes - a glance into what their future lives may hold for them. Is this a world suitable for these two young souls? Will they change their nature in order to survive? Based on a true story, this independent film is unique in its cinematic storytelling, provocative and sometimes non politically correct, yet on the other hand thought provoking and soul penetrating.",
