  "storyline": "Michele is thirteen year old, shy, unpopular at school, and in love with Stella. After wearing a costume for a Halloween party, he finds out that he's invisible.",
  "plot": "Michele Silenzi is a shy thirteen year old kid who lives with his single mum (a local police inspector). He is often overlooked at school and is picked on regularly by the school bullies. He wants to attend a fancy dress party as the object of his desires, classmate Stella, is going. Unfortunately the fifty Euro note he was to use to buy a superhero costume was stolen by the bullies. He instead has to settle for much cheaper costume that he is told belongs to an obscure Chinese superhero who has mystical powers.\n\nThe bullies embarrass him at the party by showing Stella that he has been secretly filming her on his phone. Mortified, Michele makes his escape in to the night but not before wishing the costume would make him invisible. He later discovers his wish has come true. At first he uses his power to get his own back on the bullies and to spy on his female classmates in their underwear in the changing room.\n\nIt becomes apparent that children at the school are going missing and eventually Stella is kidnapped also. Eventually a mysterious blind man tells Michele that he is his father and that both he and Michele are members of a secret Russian group called The Specials. All members of this group have superpowers and that the reason that the children are going missing is an attempt by The Specials to track Michele down.\n\nBy now Michele can control his invisibility and after escaping the leader of The Specials he helps free the children before his father wipes everyone's memory.\n\nThe film ends with the revelation that leader of The Specials is actually Michele's real mother. The final scene shows her being informed that although they have failed to recruit Michele, they have located his sister in Morocco.",
