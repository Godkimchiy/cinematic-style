  "overview": "Sophie is far from being the model little girl one would like her to be, unlike her friends Camille and Madeleine. She always insists on having her own way, often getting into trouble, to the despair of one and all. But her mother is unbending and otherwise inclined. She wants her daughter to enjoy the essential of a good upbringing. She will not let her get away with anything, and poor Sophie will often have to live with the consequences of her bad behavior and learn her lesson. Which is not always very easy!",
  "storyline": "Since her castle, the little Sophie can not resist the temptation of the forbidden and what she loves most is to do stupid things with her cousin Paul. When her parents decide to join America, Sophie is delighted. A year later, she is back in France with her horrible stepmother, Mrs. Fichini. But Sophie is going to count on the help of her two friends, the little girls and their mother, Madame de Fleurville to escape the clutches of that woman.",
  "plot": "The film is divided into three parts: The Departure, The Absence and The Return.\nThe Departure.\n\nThe film begins with Julie Pommeraye walking the streets of Paris; she goes to a cinema and from the tickets queue calls her boyfriend Isma\u00ebl B\u00e9noliel on her cell phone. He is at work with Alice, but when Julie asks him he lies and says he is alone. Julie responds that he pisses her off. Later that night, Isma\u00ebl runs into Julie on his way home. They discuss Julie\u2019s frustrations about their relationship and eventually, already in their apartment, become reconciled. Shortly afterwards Alice arrives; they all get into bed together, read a different book each and fight about each one's place in bed.\n\nThe next day Julie and Isma\u00ebl have breakfast with Julie\u2019s family; Julie gets frustrated and leaves for the kitchen, followed by her older sister, Jeanne. Julie tells Jeanne and later her mother about Alice and the threesome. In the night, after Isma\u00ebl, Julie and Alice leave a bar where they were eating, Julie starts complaining about Isma\u00ebl's relationship with Alice; Isma\u00ebl responds that so is she and that she is the only one he loves, Alice tells them that she is only there to bring them together. They go to a concert where Alice befriends a guy named Gwendal. Julie starts feeling bad, so she and Isma\u00ebl decide to leave.\nThe Absence.\n\nGoing to work, Isma\u00ebl runs into Jeanne on her way to the apartment. At work he tells about this Alice who doesn't like it; they argue then comfort each other. Since Jeanne is staying in Isma\u00ebl\u2019s apartment he doesn't want to spend the night there and Alice takes him to Gwendal\u2019s apartment.\n\nIsma\u00ebl spends the entire night awake; in the morning he meets Erwann, Gwendal\u2019s younger brother, who before leaving for school offers him his room so he can sleep in his bed. When Erwann returns and wakes Isma\u00ebl up he borrows some clean clothes from Erwann and leaves for work. When he returns from it he is secretly followed then met by Erwann who asks him if he can go home with him; Isma\u00ebl rejects this. He gets to his apartment to find Jeanne still there, which annoys him and he goes to Erwann\u2019s apartment to spend the night there again.\nThe Return.\n\nIsma\u00ebl goes to work to find Erwann waiting for him; he tells Erwann that he is flattered by his attention but neither interested nor in need of him. Alice, having broken up with Gwendal, thinks Erwan had been sent there to pick up their apartment keys; she gives them to Isma\u00ebl to pass them on to Erwann. Leaving work Isma\u00ebl finds Erwann waiting for him again; he gives him the keys then takes them back and they both go to Isma\u00ebl\u2019s apartment. Meanwhile, Alice receives a phone call from Julie\u2019s mother; the two of them meet at a restaurant, where Julie\u2019s mother asks her to take care of Isma\u00ebl. Jasmine, Julie\u2019s other sister, comes to tell her mother that her father is upset that she isn\u2019t at home so late at night, so she leaves, leaving Alice and Jasmine talking alone for a while...",
