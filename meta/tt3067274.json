  "overview": "A one-time (and now one-handed) master film editor toiling in the cinematic sweatshops of 1970s Italy becomes the prime suspect in a series of brutal murders.",
  "storyline": "Rey Ciso was once the greatest editor the world had ever seen. Since a horrific accident left him with four wooden fingers on his right hand, he's had to resort to cutting pulp films and trash pictures. When the lead actors from the film he's been editing turn up murdered at the studio, Rey is fingered as the number one suspect. The bodies continue to pile up in this absurdist giallo-thriller as Rey struggles to prove his innocence and learn the sinister truth lurking behind the scenes.",
  "plot": "A Baker and his Wife wish for a child but suffer under a curse laid upon the Baker's family by a Witch who found the Baker's father robbing her garden when his mother was pregnant. The Baker's father also stole some beans which caused the Witch's mother to punish her with the curse of ugliness. The Witch offers to lift the curse, but only if the Baker and his Wife obtain four critical items for her: a cow as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, and a slipper as pure as gold. The Witch later tells the Baker that she asked him to do this task for her because she is not allowed to touch any of the objects.\n\nThe Witch's demands eventually bring the Baker and his Wife into contact with Jack, who is selling his beloved cow, Milky-White, and to whom the Baker offers magic beans left him by his father (which were stolen from the Witch) which grow into a large beanstalk; with Red Riding Hood, whose ruby cape the couple notices when she stops to buy sweets on her way to grandmother's house; with Rapunzel, whose tower the Baker's Wife passes in the woods; and with Cinderella, who also runs into the Baker's Wife while fleeing from the pursuing Prince.\n\nAfter a series of failed attempts and misadventures, the Baker and his Wife finally are able to gather the items necessary to break the spell. Meanwhile, each of the other characters receive their \"happy endings\": Cinderella marries the Prince; Jack provides for his mother by stealing riches from the Giant in the sky, and kills the pursuing Giant by cutting down the beanstalk; Little Red Riding Hood and her Grandmother are saved from the Big Bad Wolf; and the Witch regains her youth and beauty after drinking the potion.\n\nHowever, each of the characters learns their \"happily ever after\" is not very happy: the Baker is worried he is a poor father to his newborn baby; the Baker's Wife is temporarily seduced by the Prince; Cinderella is disenchanted by the cheating Prince; and the Witch learns that she has lost her powers with her restored youth and beauty. The growth of a second beanstalk from the last remaining magic bean allows the Giant's Wife to climb down and threaten the kingdom and its inhabitants if they do not deliver Jack in retribution for killing her husband. The characters debate the morality of handing Jack over. In the process, Red Riding Hood's Mother and Grandmother, Jack's Mother, and the Baker's Wife are killed. The characters blame each other for their individual actions that lead to the tragedy, ultimately blaming the Witch for raising the beans in the first place. She curses them for their inability to accept their individual responsibilities and disappears into the ground, summoning a large pit of boiling tar in the process.\n\nThe remaining characters resolve to kill the threatening Giant's Wife, though Cinderella and the Baker try to explain to the distraught Red Riding Hood and Jack the complicated morality of retribution and revenge. The characters lure the Giant's Wife into stepping in the tar pit where she ultimately trips and falls to her death. The Giant's Wife is killed, and the characters move forward with their ruined lives. The Baker, thinking of his Wife, is determined to be a good father. Cinderella decides to leave the Prince and help the Baker, and Jack and Red Riding Hood, now orphans, are living with the Baker and Cinderella. The Baker comforts his son after he begins to cry by telling a story as the movie ends with the Witch's moral, meaning that children can change due to the parent's actions and behaviors.",
  "synopsis": "Film editor Rey Ciso works on cutting filmmaker Francesco Mancini's latest giallo movie \"Tarantola\" with his attractive assistant Bella. Once a master craftsman, Rey lost his fingers and is now handicapped by a wooden hand. After an encounter at the studio with the film's lead actor Claudio Calvetti, Rey goes home to his wife Josephine Jardin, a once-prominent actress who berates her husband while fantasizing about Claudio.An unknown killer murders Claudio while he has a private screening of the \"Tarantola\" workprint with his girlfriend Veronica. Actress Margarit Porfiry goes blind from hysteria after finding the body. Her police inspector husband Peter interviews studio employees with the help of an officer named Giancarlo. Actor Cal Konitz's hopes of having an increased role in the movie are dashed when Francesco introduces Cesare, a lookalike stand-in for Claudio.Police Chief O'Connor pressures Porfiry into closing the case because Margarit is his daughter. Porfiry begins suspecting that Rey is the killer, since Claudio's fingers were severed in the same manner as Rey's right hand. Porfiry goes to Francesco's estate for an interview and learns that Rey was once in an asylum. After Porfiry leaves, Rey's wife Josephine descends Francesco's staircase in a negligee. At church, Rey receives confession from Father Clarke.Back at the studio, Cesare is murdered in the shower and his fingers are severed. With Cesare dead, Francesco instructs Rey to re-cut the film to make Cal the new star. Porfiry asks Rey about his time in the asylum. Rey recalls how he earned his start in the business, leading to an award for editing \"The Mirror and the Guillotine,\" which was also where he met Josephine. When his wife was fired by Francesco on the next picture, the pressures of editing the world's longest film mounted and Rey cut off his own fingers in a fit of madness.Cal introducers Porfiry to his girlfriend Jasmine Rain.

Later that night, Rey has a vision of someone stalking him from the shadows in his bedroom.Porfiry infiltrates the Pilgrim Psychiatric Asylum to search for patient records on Rey Ciso. After an encounter with an inmate who tries seducing him, Porfiry meets Dr. Alberto Casini, who previously treated Rey. Casini tells Porfiry about his first meeting with Rey, when he was an up and coming editor who almost killed his assistant Giuseppe. Casini tells Porfiry the parable of Plato's cave and shows him that Giuseppe is now an inmate whose head is mysteriously wrapped in bandages.Porfiry returns home to find that Margarit now has a seeing-eye German Shepherd named Ralphie. The killer breaks into their home and tricks Porfiry into putting an ax blade into Margarit's head. Porfiry cuts off Margarit's fingers and feeds them to Ralphie to make it look as though Rey Ciso killed her. Giancarlo arrives and Porfiry confuses him into supporting false facts about the murder.O'Connor berates Porfiry over Margarit's death. The killer calls Porfiry at the station and taunts him. Porfiry convinces O'Connor into supporting a plan where Giancarlo goes undercover as the new editor at Francesco's studio.Francesco fires Rey and replaces him with Giancarlo. Rey goes home to find Josephine watching Cal's demo reel. Rey begins having strange, otherworldly visions involving Bella. Meanwhile, Bella is killed in the editing room. While trying to finish \"Tarantola,\" Giancarlo is beset by tarantulas and also dies. Francesco asks Rey to complete the film and Rey reveals that he already did so before he was fired. Francesco is ecstatic that his film is saved.Father Clarke tries convincing Porfiry that Rey is not the killer. The priest mentions his belief that Porfiry is misguided by the superstition that in Roman times, editors were believed to be bridges to the netherworld.When Cal learns that Rey edited him out of the movie, he threatens to kill Rey. Rey points out that Cal blinks whenever he tries acting, which is how he knows Cal is bluffing about killing him. Cal still vows to have his revenge.Cal takes his suspicions about Rey to Porfiry. Porfiry mentions his belief that Rey may have ties to the occult and tells Cal that the best way to get to Rey would be through his wife.Rey returns home to a ransacked living room. Cal then kidnaps Rey. Although Rey promises to put Cal back into \"Tarantola,\" Cal forces Rey to watch as he has sex with Josephine. Josephine later reveals that she plans to leave Rey for Cal.While researching the occult at the library, Porfiry is beset by tarantulas. Porfiry brings his findings to Father Clarke, who tells Porfiry about how Rey also patched the masonry in the church's bell tower. Meanwhile, the killer uses a chainsaw to murder Cal and Jasmine while they have sex.After Ralphie discovers a severed hand while playing catch, Porfiry breaks into Rey's home and finds the occult book \"Three Mothers\" by Lilith Samael. Not knowing that the book is actually Josephine's, Porfiry takes it as confirmation of Rey's ties to the netherworld and goes in search of the man.A chase between Porfiry and Rey ends with both of their cars going off a cliff. Rey flees the crash site and makes his way to Francesco's mansion, where Josephine is in the midst of sacrificing Francesco as part of an occult ritual. Porfiry chases Rey and shoots him. Josephine reveals herself to be an incarnation of Death. Porfiry attempts to shoot her, but blows off his own hand. Ultimately, Rey and Porfiry are able to kill Josephine. Porfiry reveals that Cal told him he was the person who killed Cesare, to get a better part in the film, although Josephine committed all of the other murders.Porfiry returns to the police station and O'Connor tells him to see staff doctor Casini. Porfiry also learns that Josephine and Rey were never married and that Giancarlo is the chief inspector. Porfiry claims that Giancarlo should be dead. Confused, Porfiry runs to the church and learns from Father Clarke that Rey Ciso never patched the belfry and that the bell has not rung in over 100 years. Porfiry climbs the bell tower, digs through bricks, and discovers a skull on top of a pile of film cans. Porfiry screams as he realizes that he is now in a different reality."
