  "plot": "Seventeen-year-old Charley Brewster is a fan of both traditional horror films and a horror TV series entitled Fright Night, hosted by former movie vampire hunter Peter Vincent. One evening, Charley discovers that his new next door neighbour Jerry Dandrige, is a vampire responsible for the disappearances of several victims. Charley tries to tell his mother and asks his friends for help. In desperation, he contacts the police, Detective Lennox goes with Charley to Jerry's house to question him but his roommate Billy Cole tells them that Jerry is \"away on business\" Charley reveals his suspicions and the detective furiously leaves. That night, Charley meets Jerry but is frightened to see him at his house (after Charley's friend \"Evil\" Ed Thompson tells him a vampire can't enter someone's home without an invite). Later on, Charley gets a visit from Jerry, who offers Charley a choice: forget about his vampire identity - or else. Charlie refuses, brandishing his crucifix at Jerry. When Jerry stops Charley and slowly tries to push him out the window to his death, Charlie stabs Jerry's hand with a pencil. Enraged, Jerry destroys Charley's car in retaliation and informs Charley that he will do much worse to him later.\n\nCharley turns to Peter Vincent for help, but Peter dismisses Charley as an obsessed fan. Charley's girlfriend, Amy Peterson, fearing for Charley's sanity and safety, hires the destitute Vincent to \"prove\" that Jerry is not a vampire by having him drink what they claim is \"holy water\", but it turns out to only be tap water; Jerry having claimed to Peter that drinking actual holy water would be against his religious convictions. Vincent discovers Jerry's true nature after glancing at his pocket mirror and noticing Jerry's lack of a reflection, causing him to accidentally drop and smash the mirror. Vincent then flees, but Jerry learns of his discovery after finding a piece of his pocket mirror on the floor.\n\nJerry hunts down and turns Evil into a vampire. Evil then visits Vincent and tries to attack him, only to be warded off when injured by a crucifix. Meanwhile, Jerry chases Charley and Amy into a club. While Charley is trying to call the police for help, Jerry hypnotizes and abducts Amy who bears a resemblance to Jerry's lost love (whom Jerry has a painting of). Jerry then has an intimate moment with Amy and then bites her. With nowhere left to turn, Charley attempts to gain Vincent's help once more. A frightened Vincent (following Evil's attack) initially refuses, but he then reluctantly resumes his \"Vampire Killer\" role as Charley approaches his neighbour's house. The two are able to repel Jerry's attack using a crucifix, though only Charley's works since he has faith in its spiritual power. Billy appears and knocks Charley unconscious over the banister, leaving Vincent to flee to Charley's house. There, he finds that Mrs. Brewster is still not home and is attacked by Evil, now transformed into a wolf. Vincent stakes Evil through the heart, he reverts back to his human form and dies. Vincent then removes the stake. Meanwhile, an unconscious Charley is taken to Amy who is slowly transforming into a vampire. Vincent says the process can be reversed, but only if they destroy Jerry before dawn.\n\nCharley and Vincent are then confronted by Billy whom Vincent shoots since he saw his reflection in the mirror. Jerry seemingly reanimates him. Billy rises and advances towards them being shot several times before he attacks Vincent, but is stabbed by Charley in the heart, causing him to melt into goo and dust. Jerry appears, but Vincent is able to lure the overconfident vampire in front of a window using a crucifix (now working due to his renewed faith in its abilities). Just before the morning sun, Jerry transforms into a bat and attacks Vincent and Charley (biting Charley in the process) before fleeing to his coffin in the basement. Charley and Vincent pursue Jerry; Vincent breaks open Jerry's coffin and tries to stake him through the heart while Charley fights off Amy who has completed her transformation. By breaking the blacked-out windows in the basement, Vincent and Charley expose Jerry to the sunlight, destroying him. Jerry's destruction leads Amy to revert to her human form and the three embrace.\n\nA few nights later, Vincent returns to his Fright Night TV series and announces a hiatus from vampires by instead presenting Octaman. The series is being watched by Charley and Amy as they embrace in bed. As Charley gets up to turn off the TV, he at first sees red eyes in Jerry's now-vacant house, but dismisses them. Unbeknownst to both Charley and Amy, a still undead, red-eyed Evil (hiding in the darkness) laughs and says \"Oh, you're so cool, Brewster!\"",
