  "overview": "Puppets live alongside humans peacefully, but suddenly their behavior becomes depraved. Is such criminal activity rare, or is the media blowing things out of proportion, making cops look like sadistic gunslingers and causing people to distrust them, each other, and most of all, puppets. Is the apocalypse coming, or is the fear-mongering just a great way for News programs to get advertising money? Wait \u2013 that makes this movie sound like a serious allegory. Change that. This movie has more wtf moments than you can imagine. It\u2019s high brow and low brow at the same time.",
  "storyline": "A girl finds herself on Sesame Street. After meeting a red puppet named elmo she embarks on a heart-wrenching journey exploring themes of family, depression and what it means to be human.",
