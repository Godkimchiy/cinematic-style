  "overview": "Silvi is in her late forties. Her husband has just left her. Until this point, she was fairly content with her life, but now everything is in ruins. A friend advises her to make a fresh start. But how is that supposed to work? Especially if you see yourself as a team player and there\u2019s no team in sight you would want to join. Driven by a sense of longing, helplessness and curiosity, Silvi tries to make new friends and, in her own, touchingly earnest but also na\u00efve and charmingly uninhibited way, starts to take control of her life. Anonymous sex, cosy romanticism and bondage games catapult her from one emotional disaster to the next. But, thankfully, Silvi is indestructible.",
  "storyline": "With her husband leaving, Silvi finally realizes that her rather dull marriage has failed. The 47-year-old woman, now lost and lonely, but also driven by the desire to not be alone, she decides to start over again.",
