For years, she and her recently deceased husband gave each other Christmas ornaments as gifts that represented their love for each other.

The only holiday tradition she observes now is baking Christmas cookies for her friends, which she's been doing since childhood.\n\nShortly before Christmas, Kathy meets a handsome Christmas tree shop owner, Tim (Cameron Mathison), who tries to sell her a tree, but is initially unsuccessful. The two are attracted to each other, and soon she accepts a tree from him as a gift, as well as an ornament that symbolizes hope for her. She helps him deliver his trees, and he helps her start a new cookie business\u2014something she's always dreamed of doing\u2014and brings the joy of the Christmas season back into her life.\n\nSupported by her best friend, Jenna (Jewel Staite), and her newfound feelings of love for Tim, Kathy starts to accept the message of hope symbolized by Tim's ornament.
