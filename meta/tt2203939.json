  "storyline": "After discovering her boyfriend is married, Carly Whitten tries to get her ruined life back on track. But when she accidentally meets the wife he's been cheating on, she realizes they have much in common, and her sworn enemy becomes her greatest friend. When yet another affair is discovered, all three women team up to plot mutual revenge on their cheating, lying, three-timing SOB.",
  "plot": "Carly, an attorney, has just started a relationship with Mark, a man she had sex with eight weeks earlier. She is upset when Mark tells her he has to go out of town but decides to go over to his house to seduce him. She is horrified to meet Mark's wife, Kate, whom she'd assumed to be Mark's housekeeper. While initially hostile, the two women befriend one another. Kate then discovers that he is seeing another woman, whom she initially believes to be Carly, but both she and Carly discover that Mark is seeing a third woman, Amber.\n\nCarly and Kate travel to the beach, where Kate has a run-in with Amber, and the two women inform her that Mark has been cheating on all of them. All three women then decide to take revenge on him together. They spike Mark's drinks with estrogen to swell his nipples and a laxative to cause him to defecate heavy diarrhea; and add hair-removal cream into his shampoo. In the course of carrying out their pranks, they discover that Mark has been embezzling money from various companies at his workplace. Meanwhile, Carly begins to connect romantically with Kate's brother Phil. In addition, Amber confides to Carly that she is seeing someone else as well. However, their camaraderie begins to fall apart when Kate finds herself falling in love with Mark again after an investor's dinner. Carly exposes Mark's fraud, upsetting Kate.\n\nLater, when Mark goes to the Bahamas on a supposed business trip, Kate decides to follow him there and expose him. She finds Carly and Amber at the airport, who explain that Mark has been using Kate as the owner of the companies he defrauded, which would\u2014were his fraud to be discovered\u2014result in her going to prison. Kate also finds out that Mark has been seeing yet another woman: someone he has met on this trip. This, and the possibility of facing prison, motivates her to take action with the help of Carly's legal expertise.\n\nWhen Mark returns from vacation, he visits Carly at her office. He is locked in the clear glass conference room by Carly's assistant and friend, Lydia, and is shocked to see all three women sitting together. They proceed to confront him with his infidelities and embezzlement. With Carly as her attorney, Kate presents divorce papers and a list of their assets. She reveals that she has returned the embezzled money to the companies, which saves him from prison time and leaves Mark bankrupt, much to his shock and hysterical outrage. Additionally, his business partner Nick arrives and fires Mark. In his anger and rush to leave, he smashes into the glass office. Severely injured with ripped clothes, Mark excuses himself from the women. He then finds his car being towed away and receives a punch in the face from Carly's father, Frank. Appreciating Kate's honesty, Nick offers her the chance to take over Mark's job.\n\nIn the film's epilogue, Carly and Phil fall in love, and the couple are expecting a child. Amber is in a relationship with Frank. Kate works as a CEO with Mark's former business partners, with the company making a profit under her leadership.",
  "synopsis": "The film starts with Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz) and Mark King (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) engaging in a one night stand after meeting each other on a blind date. Eight weeks later, they are in a relationship, and Carly is quite happy. Carly, a single career woman, goes to work at a law firm where she tells her friend and secretary Lydia (Nicki Minaj) about the relationship, where Lydia notes that Carly hasn't been with a single man in forever. Little does she know that Mark is married to a chatty and neurotic woman named Kate (Leslie Mann).Mark makes up an excuse to leave town for a few days, telling Carly there's an issue with the plumbing in his house. Carly is upset at this short notice, and she gets into an argument with Mark. He drops her off to have drinks with her dad Frank (Don Johnson), who is seeing a younger woman. He convinces Carly to show up at Mark's place to surprise him. She does so, dressing as a sexy plumber. She walks to his door and is greeted by Kate, who introduces herself as Mark's wife. A stunned Carly stumbles off the steps of the porch and trips backwards, knocking into a giant urn that she breaks.An angry Carly storms into her office the next day and tears up the flowers that Mark left for her. She tells Lydia that he is married, but Lydia suggests this could provide some kind of spice in their lives. Carly is later visited by a distraught Kate, who has a nervous breakdown upon realizing that Carly had slept with Mark multiple times. Despite all of this, Kate continues to find Carly and attempt to bond with her. Eventually, the two become unlikely friends. Kate later takes out her rage by destroying Mark's office with a golf club.Mark comes home and takes Kate out, leading her to feel tempted into sleeping with him. As she's in the bathroom getting herself ready, Mark gets a phone call from another woman. Kate overhears and fakes feeling unwell to not get into sex. The next day, while Kate and her brother Phil (Taylor Kinney) are fixing up the walls, she breaks down and tells him that Carly is probably still having an affair with Mark. She later confronts Carly, who says nothing is happening and she's hurt by the accusation. They figure out that Mark is seeing another woman.The ladies follow Mark to Miami and stay in Phil's beach house as they spy on Mark and his new lady. They find the couple at the beach, and both ladies are shocked to see the new, much younger, and ridiculously hot woman named Amber (Kate Upton). Carly and Kate argue about Mark's change in tastes since both Carly and Kate are in their late 30s, while Amber looks only in her early 20s. Carly runs after Amber as she jogs down the beach, and Kate stops her and the two of them struggle in a cat-fight. Amber sees them fighting in the sand and approaches. Having been caught, Carly and Kate force themselves to tell Amber that she is getting played by Mark. A little later at a parking lot, Amber is also somewhat upset and reveals that she knows who Kate is, claiming that Mark had told her that he was getting divorced, but doesn't know Carly. That evening, all three ladies get together at the beach house where even though they are mad at the same guy, they continue to bond and drink and laugh while Carly starts making a connection with Phil.The next morning, the hung-over Kate says she wants Mark to really hurt, so all three ladies conspire to get the ultimate payback on Mark, utilizing Carly's job as a lawyer, Kate's knowledge of Mark's lifestyle, and Amber's looks to get revenge.Back in New York, Kate starts to mess with Mark by putting hair removal cream in his shampoo and give him loads of estrogen in his smoothies, causing him to grow breasts. Carly meets with Mark on a date, catches him flirting with another woman, and slips laxatives into both his scotch and water. He then shits his pants and has explosive diarrhoea, then gets robbed when trying to get people to get him pants.The ladies consider having one of them take one for the team and sleep with Mark to get more information out of him. They play Rock-Paper-Scissors, leading Amber to decide she'll do it. Things get more complicated when Mark takes Kate out for a romantic dinner with his business partner Nick (David Thornton). She starts to feel romantically connected to Mark, regardless of his adultery. Carly and Amber show Kate the next day a list of companies that Mark has invested in and embezzled money from. Kate doesn't feel the strong drive for revenge as before. Carly exacerbates things by texting Mark to hang out. The ladies walk out on each other.Mark takes Kate to the Bahamas as he plans a business trip. Carly and Amber show up for Kate after Kate has given Carly an envelope with contracts from Mark's businesses, citing Kate as the CEO of the defrauded companies. They follow Mark from a hotel, where he is with yet another woman, whom he takes with him to the bank where he keeps his offshore money.On the day that the ladies plan to make their move, Kate throws her engagement and wedding rings into the ocean. Carly and Amber sit by her side on the beach. They later take her to the bank to resolve the situation.The final showdown comes when Mark is invited to Carly's law firm for a meeting. Lydia guides him to the conference room where Mark is forced to stand face-to-face with all three ladies. Kate immediately says she wants a divorce, but Mark refuses, trying to reel her back in with innocent apologizing. The ladies show Mark that Kate has returned all the money to the defrauded companies, leaving Mark with absolutely nothing while Kate gets the other half of his money. Nick comes in after being told the truth, and he fires Mark. Mark breaks down and loses his shit, throwing the papers everywhere and walking face-first into the glass wall, causing him to bleed. He runs to a computer and sees his bank accounts closed. He walks into a whole glass wall and he ruins his suit. He goes outside the building and sees his car getting towed. He screams in fury, and asks how this can get worse. Frank then comes out and punches Mark in the face, knocking him on his ass.The ladies meet one last time and toast to their friendship. The ending text states that Kate works with Nick now and is the CEO of multiple successful companies. Carly and Phil became a couple and are expecting a kid. Amber starts a relationship with Frank and they travel the globe to keep up with the summer season, though Carly refuses to call her \"Mom.\""
