  "storyline": "Romy and her husband are vacationing in the southwest US when they fight and she thinks she kills him with a lamp. She goes on the run but finally turns herself in only to find that her husband is alive. She leaves him and seeks a new life on her own. She meets Diego and starts a new life with him, but he is harboring a secret that will shake her future.",
  "plot": "Parisian Romy (Diane Kruger) and her husband (Gilles Lellouche) are vacationing in California. One night at a bar, he gets drunk and tries to rape her back in the hotel room. She hits him in the head with a lamp in defense and escapes, believing she killed him. On the run, she avoids police and tries to find work. She makes it to Las Vegas, where she meets a stripper and is able to borrow some of her costumes in order to make her own money. After speaking with some police officers, she discovers that her husband survived, and her guilt is lifted. One night Romy meets Diego (Norman Reedus). Despite him claiming he only has sex with prostitutes, they sleep together, and later he slips his address under her door. When her stripper friend throws her out, Romy travels to Diego's place out in the Californian desert, near the Mexican border. She finds out he is a park ranger, and they begin to try to be together. Eventually Romy discovers that Diego is sick- he's dying of cancer, which is why he never wanted to develop a relationship with someone. He tries to push her away and tells her to leave, but meanwhile she discovers she is pregnant. Though Diego at first tells her to have an abortion, his condition is worsening, and they reconcile. Romy remains with him until he dies, later living on his property with their child.",
