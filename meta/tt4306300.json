  "storyline": "The movie is about a hot-headed guy Ramachari, who becomes a fan of Vishnuvardhan's Ramachari from Nagarahaavu after seeing the same consequences they went through.

  "plot": "Ramachari (Yash), a hot-headed college-goer, is a fan of Vishnuvardhan from his childhood often watching his films. Inspired by the character Ramachari portrayed by Vishnuvardhan in Naagarahaavu, he gets it tattooed on his chest. Due to his waywardness, his relationship with his father (Achyuth Kumar) is damaged to an extent where the father and son cannot stand each other. His father favours his elder son Hari (Vishal Hegde), who is docile and studious; the benchmark of an ideal son.\n\nRamachari hardly attends college and mostly hangs out with his friends Dattu (Ashok Sharma) and Chikkappa, thus being resented by Dattu's mother (Malavika Avinash). At college one day, he encounters Divya (Radhika Pandit), a damsel in distress, being ragged by seniors. Divya, however is Dattus's sister, unbeknown to Ramachari. Ramachari instantly falls in love with her who too reciprocates. He prefers calling her Margaret (based on actress Shubha's character in Naagarahaavu, Vishnuvardhan's love interest). The new-found love is sweet for Divya and Ramachari and they make a hot-headed decision to get married. But, they face problems with their relationship, which leads to a painful breakup.\n\nRamachari agrees to marry a girl of his father's choice to save his honor, and on hearing this, Divya attempts suicide. Later, Divya seemingly overcomes her hurt and agrees to marry Aakash (Sameer Dattani), a boy of her mother's choice. Both marriages are set on the same date and in the same town of Chitradurga. Both the weddings are managed by a wedding planner, Manche Gowda (Sadhu Kokila), who mixes up the photos of bride and groom, leading to confusing situations between either parties. On the day of the wedding, Ramachari gets his fiance married to her boyfriend Farhan and performs a monologue by Vishnuvardhan's statue at Chitradurga fort. When Divya learns of this, she breaks her engagement and goes on to unite with him.",
