  "overview": "\"The Hollow Point\" tells the story of a botched Mexican cartel deal in the back roads of a border town. The town's new sheriff (Wilson) must team up with the retired lawman he replaced to investigate the source of the deal in order to stop a mysterious cartel butcher and his systematic brutalization of the town's residents.",
  "storyline": "Across the Southwest United States, dozens of towns in the Mexican borders are being plagued by arms dealers who make a fortune by smuggling guns and ammunition to arm the cartels. Rumoured to be dead, Sheriff Wallace returns as the prodigal son to his hometown in Los Reyes County, Arizona, to replace Leland, the unapologetic, small-town man of the law after a routine check that went terribly wrong and forced him to retire. Soon enough, Wallace will get caught in the middle of a bloody inquiry trying to find out those who struck the profitable deal, while at the same time, a stash of blood-money and a kill list made by the relentless Atticus, the cartel's resilient hit man, threatens the town's peace. From now on, there will be no arresting anymore.",
  "plot": "An FBI agent and a former DEA agent team up with a cunning hitman to foil a crazed mob boss's plans for world domination.",
