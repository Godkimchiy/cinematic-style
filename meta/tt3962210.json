  "overview": "The big-budget, epic film on young King David who took on the mighty warrior Goliath against all odds.",
  "storyline": "Young David, a.k.a. Shepherd Boy, has more faith in God than anyone else among his people. If no one in Saul's army will take on Goliath - the champion man-slayer among Leader Jaggar's Philistines - he will. David's soldier brothers, Eliab and Abinadab, have no encouragement for their underage sibling's foolhardy venture and do all they can to crush it; but, with no one else showing a gram of moxie to stand against the taunting giant, Saul finally permits the confrontation and prepares for the young lad's certain death - a determined boy who stubbornly approaches the giant without sword, spear or protective leather vest.",
  "plot": "David (Jayasurya) is an orphan who is abandoned outside an isolated church on a tea plantation. He is rescued by Father Gerald (P. Balachandran) and grows up to be a smart and pious boy under the tutelage of the priest. But David has a problem: he gets nervous and gets nose bleeds whenever he is surrounded by people. He has to drop out of school because of this but he is a genius and displays an astounding expertise when it comes to creating machines. After the death of Father Gerald David becomes alone in the world. Sunny (Anoop Menon) who is a planter and a failed businessman discovers one of David's creativity, and reaps a fortune with that. The story of weak and strong starts here.",
