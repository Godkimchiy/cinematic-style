  "overview": "Radical Grace follows three fearless nuns who risk their place in the Catholic Church to follow another higher calling: social justice. When the Vatican reprimands the sisters \u2013 citing their \u201cradical feminism\u201d \u2013 they become the spiritual and symbolic center of a battle for the heart of the Catholic Church. From their cross-country Nuns on the Bus tour, to serving those on the margins, to a continued struggle for women\u2019s religious equality under Pope Francis, these sisters are transforming American politics \u2014 and the Church itself.",
  "storyline": "Today, Pope Francis is changing the Vatican's conservative tone. But for decades, U.S. nuns have been bucking the Church hierarchy by living a gospel of love, social justice and inclusion. From confronting U.S. bishops over the Affordable Care Act, to protesting for women's equality at the Vatican, Radical Grace follows three sisters who transform American politics and the Catholic Church.",
