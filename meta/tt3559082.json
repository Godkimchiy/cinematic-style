  "overview": "Le Gouffre is a 10-min 3D animated short film about two travelers who undertake the construction of a gigantic bridge in order to cross a gulf blocking their way. It was animated, directed and produced by Lightning Boy Studio, a small independent team of three animators living in Montreal, Canada. The project took more than two years of full-time work to complete and was mostly self-financed, getting access to outside funding only at the very end of the production.",
