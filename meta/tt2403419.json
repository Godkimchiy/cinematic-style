All this could be the beginning of a normal afternoon for a young college student. Just a normal afternoon...But what if going through that doorway, you go into the mouth of evil, into Diamantina's and Elisa playroom and you, the young student, become the toy of a demented being? Then it is not just a normal afternoon. It's the last."
