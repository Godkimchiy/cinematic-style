  "overview": "There have been numerous treatments, in various media, of the horrific 1955 murder in Money, Mississippi, of 14-year-old Chicagoan Emmett Till, but none like this concise, stunning dramatization in which actor-writer Mike Wiley plays all 36 roles--black, white, male, female, young, and old.

Milam, agree to sit down to discuss the trial. Not a word had been uttered outside a courtroom by them or their kin, until now... * DAR HE: The Lynching of Emmett Till, is the TRUE STORY crafted from the public record: a transfixing, true-dramatization of the historic interviews and events surrounding the murder that became a lightning rod for moral outrage and pivotal in inspiring a whole generation of young people to commit to social change in the 1950s. 'His death was a spark that ignited the Civil Rights Movement in America,' Ed Bradley, Emmy Award-winning journalist. * The film was adapted from the acclaimed one-man play written and performed by Mike...",
