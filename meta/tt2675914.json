Suspecting foul play, Nils begins to investigate, and soon finds himself at the center of an escalating underworld gang war between Serbian drug dealers and a sociopathic criminal mastermind known only as \u201cThe Count.\u201d",
  "storyline": "Nils ploughs snow in the wild winter mountains of Norway, and is recently awarded a Citizen of the Year Award. When his son is murdered for something he did not do, Nils wants revenge. And justice. His actions ignite a war between the vegan gangster \"the Count\" and the Serbian mafia boss \"Papa\". Winning a blood feud isn't easy, especially not in a welfare state. But Nils has something going for him: Heavy machinery and beginners luck.",

Nils knows his son was no addict but does not know what happened. While grieving he learns the local drug gang is behind the crime. He hunts down the two killers and kills both of them, but not before they confess. Based on this information, he goes after their boss. But a retaliation killing by the local boss puts him in the crossfire between two rival gangs: one local, one \"imported\" from Serbia.",
