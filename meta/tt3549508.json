  "synopsis": "Time Is Illmatic is a feature length documentary film that delves deep into the making of Nas 1994 debut album, Illmatic, and the social conditions that influenced its creation. Twenty years after its release, Illmatic has become a hip-hop benchmark that encapsulates the socio-political outlook, enduring spirit, and collective angst of a generation of young black men searching for a voice in America. Time is Illmatic tracks the musical legacy of the Jones family, handed down to Nas from his jazz musician father, Olu Dara. It also examines the social conditions and environmental influences that contributed to Nas worldview. Along the way, Time Is Illmatic shows how Naswith the support of his Queensbridge neighborhood crew; the loyalty of his younger brother Jabari Jungle Jones; and sacrifices of his mother, Ann Jonesovercame insurmountable odds to create one of hip-hops greatest works."
