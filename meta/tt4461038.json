  "overview": "Helge Schneider's extraordinary talent is his ability to improvise which shows his unfailing creativity. \"I paint the everyday-life in the brightest colors myself\", he says about himself. Reality and fiction are tough to tell apart in his life. How does a man like him, who doesn't want his audience to know too much about himself, react on a documentary portraying him as a person?",
  "storyline": "Helge Schneider is one of the most extraordinary German artists. Jazz musician, entertainer, film director, actor and clown. His exceptional talent is his improvisational skill. This is where he shows his bubbling creativity. 'I make the everyday grey colorful,' is what he says about himself. In his world, the fantastic coexists with the everyday and it is difficult to define the boundaries between reality and fiction. Even in his communication with his audiences, this element of disguise is used, humorously conveying his attitude toward the world. But how does Helge Schneider react to a filmmaker who approaches him to make a portrait about him? It is very clear that he is not going to offer his secrets on a silver platter. He doesn't like for people to know too much about him... so the viewer has to accompany him on this journey - and determine for himself just where fiction begins, and where it ends.",
