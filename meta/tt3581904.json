  "overview": "A young woman lies dead in a house, strangled by her boyfriend in a fit of jealous rage. Full of steroids and remorse, he waits for the law to arrive. But the law is his father, a powerful and corrupt detective who races to the murder scene first so he can tamper with the evidence and thwart the police case. When the son literally gets away with murder, the dead woman's distraught brother Jeremy arranges his own justice.",
  "storyline": "Lindy Wilman's violent and jealous fiance Billy Stafford strangles her after she says she's leaving him. Billy should go straight to jail, except that his father is the ruthless and scheming detective inspector Ken Stafford who will do anything to stop his son being put away. Stafford tampers with the murder scene evidence so a jury can't be 100 per cent sure what happened and lets his son goes free. But Billy's reprieve doesn't last long. Soon after the verdict he's run over and killed in an eye-for-an-eye hit arranged by Lindy's outraged brother Jeremy. Jeremy and his family have their revenge and justice is served. Except the careless hitman has left clues which send Jeremy on the run from the murderous Inspector Stafford.",
