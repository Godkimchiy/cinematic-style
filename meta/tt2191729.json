  "overview": "You may not recognize the name Ralf K\u00f6nig, but you probably recognize his art. One of the\r most commercially successful German comic book creators, he is best known for books\r like \u201cSchwulComix (GayComix)\u201d that offer a twisted take on queer culture. Equal parts\r Tom of Finland and R. Crumb, K\u00f6nig\u2019s comics are sexually charged and often politically\r incorrect, portraying daily routines of gay life alongside serious subjects like AIDS.  King of Comics is a touching portrait of a cutting-edge artist with a wicked sense of humor. All hail the king! \u2014Jimmy Radosta",
  "storyline": "Ralf K\u00f6nig, one of the most successful German cartoonists, became famous with his comic book \"The Most Desired Man,\" which was made into a film in starring Til Schweiger back in 1994. Wittily playing with queer clich\u00e9s, he also reaches a wide heterosexual audience. In King of Comics, busy filmmaker Rosa von Praunheim (The Einstein of Sex, I Am My Own Woman, Rent Boys) portrays an unpretentious and modest man whom, with brilliant observational skills, has left his outlandish, yet intelligent, incredibly fun and delightfully graphic mark on an entire generation.",
  "plot": "In 1845, James Howlett, a boy living in Canada, witnesses his father being killed by groundskeeper Thomas Logan. The trauma activates the boy's mutation: bone claws protrude from his knuckles, and he impales Thomas, who reveals that he is James' real father before dying. James flees along with Thomas' son Victor Creed, who is thus James's half-brother and has a healing factor mutation like James. They spend the next century as soldiers, fighting in the American Civil War, both World Wars, and the Vietnam War. In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman, and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James happens upon the fight and defends Victor, resulting in the pair being sentenced to execution by firing squad, which they survive due to their mutant healing abilities. Major William Stryker approaches them in military custody and offers them membership in Team X, a group of mutants including Agent Zero, Wade Wilson, John Wraith, Fred Dukes, and Chris Bradley. They join the team for a few years, with James now using the alias Logan, but Victor and the group's disregard for human life causes Logan to leave.\n\nSix years later, Logan is working as a lumberjack in Canada, where he lives with his girlfriend Kayla Silverfox. Stryker and Zero approach Logan at work. Stryker reports that Wade and Bradley have been killed, and he thinks someone is targeting the team's members. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker, but after finding Kayla's bloodied body in the woods, Logan realizes Victor is responsible. He finds him at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue, and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with adamantium, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker attempts to betray Logan by ordering that his memory be erased so he can be used as Stryker's personal weapon, but Logan overhears this and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple take him in. Zero kills them the following morning and tries to kill Logan, but Logan takes down Zero's helicopter and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor.\n\nLogan locates John and Fred at a boxing club. Fred explains that Victor is still working for Stryker, hunting down mutants for Stryker to experiment on at his new laboratory, located at a place called \"The Island\". Fred mentions Remy \"Gambit\" LeBeau, the only one who escaped from the island and therefore knows its location. John and Logan find LeBeau in New Orleans, then both fight Victor, who kills John and extracts his DNA. Agreeing to help release mutants that Stryker has captured, Gambit takes Logan to Stryker's facility on Three Mile Island. Logan learns that Kayla is alive, having been coerced by Stryker into surveilling him in exchange for her sister's safety. However, Stryker refuses to release her sister and denies Victor the adamantium bonding promised for his service, claiming that test results revealed Victor would not survive the operation. Stryker activates Wade, now known as Weapon XI, a \"mutant killer\" with the powers of multiple mutants.\n\nWhile Logan and Victor join forces to fight Weapon XI, Kayla is mortally wounded leading the captive mutants to Professor Charles Xavier and safety. After Logan decapitates Weapon XI, Stryker arrives and shoots Logan in the head with adamantium bullets, rendering Logan unconscious. Before Stryker can shoot Kayla, she grabs him and uses her mutant power to persuade him to turn around and walk away until his feet bleed. Logan regains consciousness but has lost his memory. He notices his dog tags read \"Logan\" on one side and \"Wolverine\" on the other. He pauses upon noticing Kayla's body, but does not recognize her, and leaves the island.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Stryker is detained for questioning by some MPs in connection with the death of his superior, General Munson, whom Stryker killed after Munson declared his intention to shut down Stryker's project. There were two alternate post-credits scenes that were shown at different screenings. One post-credit scene reveals a surprise twist on the fate of Weapon XI/Deadpool. The other post-credit scene shows Logan in Japan where he tells a barmaid he is \"drinking to remember\". This scene was later removed from the film and included as a deleted scene on the blu-ray release, since Logan's visit to Japan was eventually shown to not have happened until many years later in the film The Wolverine.",
