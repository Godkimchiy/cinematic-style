  "plot": "In a fictional outcome for the Canadian federal election, 2015, a political party comes to power and establishes a law called S-14, allowing parents of troubled children and limited finances to place their children in hospitals, without regard for fundamental justice. After the law is passed, Diane \"Die\" Despr\u00e9s, a widowed mother and 46-year-old journalist, picks up her son Steve, who has ADHD with violent tendencies, from an institution. Steve has started a fire at the institution, in which another youth was injured. Die brings Steve home, and struggles to care for him under financial distress. He gives her jewelry reading \"Mommy\", which she suspects he has stolen. Enraged by the accusation, Steve begins choking her, and she defends herself by hitting him with a glass frame. Kyla, a neighbour and teacher on sabbatical, shows up to tend to their wounds.\n\nKyla, who is dealing with a stuttering problem, begins to tutor Steve, and Steve indicates he is glad to know her and respects her wishes not to call her \"babe\". Although the three have bonded, Die is served papers indicating she and Steve are being sued for the injuries caused by his fire.\n\nDie finds a lawyer willing to help them, but Steve drives him away due to what he perceives as the lawyer's sexual interest in Die. While at a store, Steve stabs himself, but survives. Overwhelmed, Die attempts to commit Steve to a hospital. She regrets the decision when she sees the officials use violence and tasers to subdue Steve, but there is nothing she can legally do. Kyla moves to Toronto while Die attempts to regain custody of her son. Immediately after being unstrapped by hospital officials, Steve flees.",
