  "plot": null,
  "synopsis": "Set in a small coastal town in Konkan, the film is intimately interwoven with forests, animals, a lake and the\nsea. These essential elements become the stage on which young Chinu struggles for acceptance and identity when his mother, who works in a government office gets transferred from a bigger town to a village. His father has recently died and the two are on their own in a small house. Far from his settled world Chinu has a lot on his plate. Local lads seem like unruly delinquents to him when he first encounters them trying to set fire to a puppy. Chinu passes Yuvraj some answers in math class, and gains a friend. His mother, meanwhile, has her own conflicts to face in the local corrupt bureaucracy when shes strong-armed into helping a local building contractor get a project through without bank approval. Far from her family she has her set of struggles and worries about her son.The climax comes early on, in a genuinely spooky scene in the ruins of a British fort, where Chinu undergoes an ordeal that becomes a rite of passage."
