  "overview": "The two-hour sketch comedy show-meets-concert film builds upon and punctuates the multimedia format of the band's live performances with skits from the stable of Puscifer characters such as Billy D, Hildy and Major Douche woven into the performance footage of the Maynard James Keenan led quintet.\"Being surrounded by so many talented and creative people is an endless source of inspiration. This film only scratches the surface of how deep our proverbial rabbit hole goes. What Is Puscifer is meant to conjure as many questions as it answers,\" explained Maynard James Keenan.Puscifer's concerts have been praised for their out-of-the-box take on what a live performance can be, with the Orange County Register saying \"the production matters as much as the music\" and describing the event as \"a thought-provoking, senses-jabbing statement on a variety of topics.\"",
