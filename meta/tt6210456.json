  "storyline": "Frank James Solomon will let nothing get in the way of his dream of being a pro surfer. He battles waves, attacks problems head on and busts down barriers. His many complex facades are a source of intrigue for our narrator, an inquisitive aristocrat. Our conspirator guides us through mirrored worlds of fact and fiction, proposing wild theories and exposing a realm that lies somewhere between reality and what we are continuously told to believe. Let's Be Frank draws together a cast of iconic surfers, including John John Florence, Jamie O'Brien and Pat O'Connell, with actors such as Cokey Falkow (Penny Dreadful) and Michael Redmond (Vikings), to tell a genre busting, multi-layered story of big wave hold downs, back street beat-downs and North Shore show-downs. Up-and-coming Director Peter Hamblin has produced a trademark visual feast combining stunning cinematography with a fast-paced, edgy storyline.

He comforts her, the two talk and share a kiss, and he shoots her. After she dies, he ponders what she was running from before mentioning that he will cash her check in the morning.\n\"That Yellow Bastard (Part I)\"\n\nOn the docks of Sin City, aging police officer John Hartigan tries to stop serial child-killer Roark Junior from raping and killing his fourth victim, eleven-year-old Nancy Callahan. Junior is the son of Senator Roark, who bribes the police to cover up his son's crimes. Hartigan's partner, Bob, tries to convince Hartigan to walk away, but Hartigan knocks him out. Fighting off the pain caused by his bad heart, Hartigan confronts Junior, and shoots off his ear, right hand and genitals. Bob then arrives and shoots Hartigan in the back, revealing himself to be on Senator Roark's payroll. As sirens approach, Nancy comforts Hartigan as he passes out, as he reasons that the death of an old man is a fair trade for a young girl's life.\n\"The Hard Goodbye\"\n\nAfter a one-night stand, Marv awakens to find that Goldie, the woman he slept with, has been murdered. Realizing he has been set up, he escapes the police that have arrived to arrest him, vowing to avenge her death. Marv interrogates several informants, working his way up to a corrupt priest who reveals that the Roark family was behind the murder. After killing the priest, Marv is attacked by a woman who looks like Goldie. Marv goes to the Roark farm where he is subdued by silent stalker Kevin and imprisoned. Marv awakens to find his parole officer, Lucille, has also been captured after looking into his story, and she tells him that Kevin is a cannibal and that his victims, including Goldie, are prostitutes.

Marv kills the squad, interrogates the leader, and finds out that Cardinal Patrick Henry Roark arranged for Goldie's murder.\n\nMarv goes to Old Town, Sin City's prostitute-run red-light district, to learn more about Goldie, and is captured and tortured by her twin sister, Wendy, whom Marv previously dismissed as a hallucination. He convinces her that he is not the killer and she resolves to help him avenge Goldie. They return to the farm, where Marv attacks and slowly dismembers Kevin, before feeding him to his own pet wolf. He brings Kevin's head to Cardinal Roark, who confesses to his part in the murders, before Marv brutally murders him too and is immediately captured by Roark's guards. Marv is blackmailed into confessing to the murder of Cardinal Roark and the women Kevin killed, and sentenced to be executed. Wendy visits him the night before and pretends to be Goldie as a way of thanking him for avenging her sister and the next day, Marv is executed via electric chair.\n\"The Big Fat Kill\"\n\nDwight McCarthy is with his waitress girlfriend Shellie, when her drunken ex-boyfriend, Jackie Boy, and his friends show up at her apartment.
