  "overview": "A bunch of wedding caterers lead by Santhanam run from trouble and land in Trichy - only to find more trouble. In Trichy, the problems are bigger than before and running away is not an option. When Vishal realises it, he uses force to handle the situation. What follows is an action scene right at the end of first half. This is followed by the revelation of Vishal's bitter past that has its share of some melodrama.",
  "storyline": "In Karaikudi, Gouravam is a well-known traditional cook making a living undertaking orders for marriage functions. He is forced into taking an order for a local goon's wedding and is not happy about it. Saravanan (Vishal) and his four friends, who come to work for him as junior cooks, offer to help him but land him in even greater trouble and they are forced to flee from Karaikudi. The story shifts to Trichy, where Saravanan and his friends have grand plans of opening a restaurant with the help of Gouravam and his money. Here, just like in Malaikottai, it is love at first sight for Saravanan when he sees Aishwarya.",
