  "overview": "David and Brenda are perfect for each other, and everyone knows it except David and Brenda. After a break-up, they each experience their own rough patch. For David, a self-destructive artistic endeavor and a relationship with an immature beauty\u2014for Brenda, a failing acting career, an eviction notice, and a boyfriend who just doesn\u2019t do it for her. A chance encounter brings them together on the streets of New York at a particularly bad time. David invites Brenda to the opening of his first photography exhibit and the stage is set for a night of drinking and flirting which leads to an untraditional proposal of how they can be together without getting back together. A sharply observed, un-romantic comedy by writer/director Mel Rodriguez III, IN STEREO is a stylish and striking first feature that offers an unflinching look at the complexity of modern relationships.",
  "storyline": "David and Brenda are perfect for each other, and everyone knows it except David and Brenda. After they break up, due to mutual immaturity, they voyage through a romantic Purgatory that shakes both of them to their core, until they realize what's apparent, and work out a design for being together that they refuse to call \"being together\". A sharply observed, dark comedy about the complexity of modern relationships, In Stereo is a humorous look into the lives of confused 30 somethings trying to figure it all out.",
