The film explores the rise of the group during the 1990s Balkan conflict when economic sanctions imposed on Serbia fueled illegal activities. The criminals reveal an underworld driven by fast wealth and paranoia, while the detectives and inspectors, who are working with Interpol, are on a mission to stop their crime spree with growing success.",

But as the thieves brazenly commit their crimes across the world - Europe, Asia and The U.A.E. - Interpol and global police forces are tightening their grip. As many of the criminals responsible for are caught and extradited, this film asks: Is this the end of the Pink Panthers?",
