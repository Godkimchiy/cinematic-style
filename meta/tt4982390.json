  "storyline": "The leader of CIS goes missing. The agent Clank tries his best to track down an arms dealer in league with a dangerous organization. This leads to Clank deciding to fill in as the new CIS leader while the agents rebuild their former status. However, the biggest mystery lies with a stranger who appears from a shadowy past.",
  "plot": "In a warbot factory on planet Quartu, a defective but intelligent robot escapes and crash-lands on Veldin, the homeworld of the mechanic Ratchet. After being repaired, Clank reveals that he is on a mission to stop Chairman Drek, a corrupt business tycoon who harvests inhabited planets to create a new one for his new race, the Blarg. Joining forces, the two take out several of Drek's operations one-by-one while gathering gradual information on his plans. This move enrages Drek, who subsequently launches a manhunt for the duo.\n\nRatchet and Clank enlist the help of Captain Qwark, the Solana Galaxy's most popular superhero/celebrity; the three agree to meet at Qwark's private headquarters on Umbris. After survivng his obstacle course, Ratchet and Clank are betrayed by Qwark, who reveals that he was working for Drek the entire time as a spokesperson for the Chairman's new planet. Qwark leaves the duo to die in the lair of his Blargian Snagglebeast, which is easily dispatched by Ratchet. Hell-bent on getting revenge for Qwark's deception, Ratchet and Clank liberate more Blarg-conquered planets, eventually coming across a Blargian moonbase. Qwark, attempting to make sure that the duo don't interfere in Drek's plans, engages them in a gruelling space battle that ends with Qwark being shot down and Ratchet and Clank leaving in satisfaction, their vengeance finally laid to rest.\n\nRatchet and Clank fly to Quartu in order to find out about the Blarg's next move. Immediately after realizing that Drek intends to destroy Veldin with a planet-destroying weapon called the Deplanetizer and allow his already-completed planet to take its place of orbit, Ratchet swears to kill Drek for his mercilessness. The Blarg and Drek are pursued to Veldin by a vengeful Ratchet, and soon a vicious battle ensues. Halfway through the fight, Drek reveals that he intends to repeat the whole process over-and-over again until he becomes the richest person in the galaxy. Ratchet launches Drek to his new planet, which is destroyed when Ratchet fires the Deplanetizer at it, killing Drek. Clank, feeling worthless now that his mission is complete, prepares to leave but Ratchet convinces him to stay.\n\nIn a post-credits scene, Qwark advertises his \"Personal Hygienator\", much to Ratchet and Clank's disgust.",
