  "overview": "'The Ambiguity of David Thomas Broughton' is a musical documentary following the creative process of one of the UK\u2019s most enigmatic musicians and performers.  As a musical act, David Thomas Broughton is almost unclassifiable. His live shows are a exhilarating mix of musical experimentation and performance art, underlined with a raw unpredictability. His recorded material is dark but beautiful, marrying traditional folk with a surrealist edge. Off-stage, he\u2019s an introvert with a passion for bird watching.  Who is the real David Thomas Broughton? Through a series of interviews with friends, family and collaborators, filmmaker Greg Butler attempts to unravel this ambiguity.  His journey takes him to David\u2019s home town of Otley, where we track David\u2019s creative process as he records new material to be played at the End of the Road Festival.",
