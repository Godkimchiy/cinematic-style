He and Tun Dr Ismail decide to share a doctor and Tun Dr Ismail's reading room becomes their makeshift clinic where they are both treated by Dr Macpherson.They both carry an aura of strength and authority. Their courage and determination capture the hearts and imagination of the people, particularly the younger set like University student and lecturer, Zarah and Kara, student cum office boy, Zaman and their friends.Dismayed when he is told by doctors he has only 2 years to live, Tun Razak is thankful that his trusted friend Tun Dr Ismail who is well-known for his integrity and forthrightness, would be there to carry on their plans for the country's development.Razak knows he could rely on Ismail's promise to watch over his family when he is gone. But as fate would have it, Ismail's sudden passing from a massive heart attack, shakes Razak to the core, almost worsening his health condition.He begins to race against time, implementing various plans to ensure the country's stability and future development despite threats from communist elements that are targeting his top police officers.Razak takes the bold step of establishing diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China to weaken the local communist influence, risking vilification by certain Western counterparts and Allies. His unqualified success with China where he is accorded a rousing and warm welcome galvanizes his subversive detractors into action.They assassinate three Police top brass, the IGP and the Perak CPO, Khoo, in cold blood but fail in their attempt to assassinate DSP Kulasingam who survives the 18 shots. Haniff, the new IGP, promises Razak that he will not rest until the murderers are tracked and captured.Razak's policies begin to bear fruit bringing hard-core poor, families like Zarah and Zaman's, out of poverty. And Razak becomes a symbol of their newfound hope. He tries hard to fight his illness, asking Doctors to let him return home to Malaysia. But Razak's struggle ends at a London clinic where he breathes his last, while Malaysians who are expecting his return, are caught unawares."
