  "overview": "The film tells the story of longtime married couple Lena and Tore, who need to deal with Lena's sudden lost of biographical memory due to amnesia.",
  "storyline": "Lena, who has long been married to Tore, suddenly experiences a retrograde amnesia, as doctors describe her condition. The cause is an undiagnosed encephalitis. As a result,she lost her entire memory overnight. She can still speak, but all memories of her previous life are extinguished. Her friends and parents are suddenly strangers to her. Even her husband does not recognize her again. Her old life becomes for her a story that others have to describe. First, she tries to fulfill her \"old\" role in this story, in order to meet the expectations of her social environment. But she develops her own individual personality, which refuses to do what her environment expects of her and what she is urged to do - namely, to become herself. From time to time, she realizes that her \"new\" self has completely different desires and needs.",
