  "storyline": "A dysfunctional gang of criminals takes a middle class Maori family hostage and discovers too late that they are cannibals.",
  "plot": "The plot revolves around the lives of six students \u2014 Vod, Oregon, Josie, Kingsley, JP and Howard \u2014 who are freshers (with the exception of Howard) at the fictional Manchester Medlock University (Loosely based on Manchester Metropolitan University). They live in a shared house off-campus in Rusholme rather than university halls of residence, due to their late application.\n\nMain themes include Oregon's insecurity and failed relationship with her lecturer, Tony Shales; Vod's hedonistic, carefree lifestyle; Josie and Kingsley's tortured relationship; upper-class JP's attempts at popularity and impressing girls; and Howard's many eccentricities. On a larger scale, the series covers many student-related issues, including financial issues, work pressures and grades, expulsion, partying, and internship competition. In the final series, a major theme is job seeking, final exam pressure and the value of degrees.",
