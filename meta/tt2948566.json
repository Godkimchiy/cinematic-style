  "plot": "On November 1988, Vinny Pazienza (Teller) loses to Roger Mayweather for the WBC World Light Welterweight Title. His boxing manager Lou Duva (Levine) causes a scene by attempting to go after Mayweather but he is punched by Mayweather. Following his loss, Duva tells the media that Vinny should retire from the career, causing Vinny's father Angelo (Hinds), who serves him as a coach, to confront Duva. Vinny wants another fight and hires Kevin Rooney (Eckhart) as his coach.\n\nAngelo receives a confirmation that Vinny will fight against Gilbert Dele. At the ring, Vinny wins via technical knockout in the second round, now holding the WBA World Light Middleweight Title. Some days later, Angelo tells Vinny that he will be fighting Panaman boxer Roberto Dur\u00e1n sooner but Angelo is anxious about his loss against Dur\u00e1n. Vinny is then picked up by his friend Jimmy to get some coffee. On their way, they are hit by an incoming car. Jimmy survives with less injury but Vinny is critically injured, breaking his neck. At the hospital, upon regaining consciousness, the doctor informs Vinny that he might never walk again and would certainly never fight again. Four days after the accident, as recommended by the doctor, Vinny had to wear Halo, a medical device in which a circular metal brace is screwed into the skull in four spots and propped up with four metal rods. Despite the injuries, Vinny is convinced that he will fight again but the notion is rejected by Kevin.\n\nDisobeying the doctors' advice, Vinny begins to work out at his basement with only Kevin knowing about it. When Angelo finally discovers this, he confronts Vinny for not informing him. Six months after the accident, Vinny had to endure the pain of removing the screws of Halo without taking any sedatives. In his comeback match, it is confirmed that Vinny will fight against Dur\u00e1n. In 1995, at the ring, held in Las Vegas, in the first six rounds, Vinny is apparently overpowered by Dur\u00e1n but eventually Vinny \u2014 inspired by the car accident, the Halo, and working out since the accident \u2014 lands a good punch in the last round. Vinny won via split decision (114-114, 115-113, 115-113).\n\nIn the final scene, Vinny is interviewed by the journalist about the biggest lies that they told him.",
