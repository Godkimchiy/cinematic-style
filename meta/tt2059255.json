  "overview": "In 1988, Chilean military dictator Augusto Pinochet, due to international pressure, is forced to call a plebiscite on his presidency. The country will vote \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 to Pinochet extending his rule for another eight years. Opposition leaders for the \u2018No\u2019 vote persuade a brash young advertising executive, Rene Saavedra, to spearhead their campaign. Against all odds, with scant resources and while under scrutiny by the despot\u2019s minions, Saavedra and his team devise an audacious plan to win the election and set Chile free.",
  "storyline": "Military dictator Augusto Pinochet calls for a referendum to decide his permanence in power in 1988, the leaders of the opposition persuade a young daring advertising executive - Ren\u00e9 Saavedra - to head their campaign. With limited resources and under the constant scrutiny of the despot's watchmen, Saavedra and his team conceive of a bold plan to win the election and free their country from oppression.",
  "plot": "After fifteen years of military dictatorship and facing considerable international pressure, Chile's government asks the public of Chile to vote in the national plebiscite of 1988 on whether General Augusto Pinochet should stay in power for another eight years, or there should be an open democratic presidential election the following year.\n\nRen\u00e9 Saavedra, a successful advertisement creator, is approached by the \"No\" side to consult on their proposed advertising. Behind the back of his politically conservative boss, Saavedra agrees to participate and finds that the advertising is a dourly unappealing litany of the regime's abuses created by an organization that has no confidence in its efforts. Enticed by the marketing challenge, and his own loathing of Pinochet's tyranny, he proposes to the advertising subcommittee that they take a lighthearted, upbeat promotional approach stressing abstract concepts like \"happiness\" to challenge concerns that voting in a referendum under a notoriously brutal military junta would be politically meaningless and dangerous.\n\nWhile the unorthodox marketing theme is dismissed by some \"No\" members as a facile dismissal of the regime's horrific abuses, the proposal is approved for the campaign. Saavedra, his son and his comrades are eventually targeted and intimidated by the authorities. Eventually, Saavedra's boss Lucho finds out about his employee's activities, but when Saavedra refuses an offer to become a partner if he withdraws, Lucho goes to head the \"Yes\" campaign as a matter of survival.\n\nThe historic campaign took place in 27 nights of television advertisements, in which each side had 15 minutes per night to present its point of view. During that month, the \"No\" campaign, created by the majority of Chile's artistic community, proved effective with a series of entertaining and insightful presentations that had an irresistible cross-demographic appeal. By contrast, the \"Yes\" campaign's advertising, with only dry positive economic data in its favor and few creative personnel on call, was derided even by government officials as crass and heavy-handed.\n\nAlthough the government tries to interfere with the \"No\" side with further intimidation and blatant censorship, Saavedra and his team use those tactics to their favor in their marketing, and public sympathy shifts to them. As the campaign heats up in the concluding days with international Hollywood celebrity spots and wildly popular street concert rallies of the \"No\" campaign, while the \"Yes\" side is reduced to desperately parodying the \"No\" ads.\n\nOn the day of the referendum, it momentarily appears that the \"Yes\" vote has the lead, but the final result turns out to be firmly on the \"No\" side. The final proof only comes when the troops surrounding the No headquarters withdraw, as the news of the Chilean senior military command forcing Pinochet to concede comes through. After the success, Saavedra and his boss resume their normal advertising business with a new Chile being born.",
