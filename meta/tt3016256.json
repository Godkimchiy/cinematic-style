  "overview": "Alex and his girlfriend Anna have a problem: Anna couldn't be more pregnant, and neither can find an affordable flat. The only one who can help is Anna's father, Commander Reiker, a sweet but screwy military man who owns an empty house. Reiker, however, to whom the Swiss Army means everything, has problems of his own: how can Switzerland, nation of fabled warriors that even exports its troops to protect the Pope, maintain its fear-inspiring reputation with all the cost-cutting measures? The Army is being forced to save, to restructure, and to take itself seriously. To prevent his ramshackle troops from being axed, Reiker urgently needs help. And just about anyone will do. Like his future son-in-law Alex, the least capable man one could imagine. As a yoga teacher, house-husband and pacifist, Alex has what it takes to be discharged, not put in charge. The pact he concludes with Reiker will not only shake up the Swiss Army, but also Alex's relationship with Anna...",
  "storyline": "Expecting their first baby, Alex, the yoga instructor, and Anna, medical nurse working double shifts, try to find an apartment within the month. Anna's estranged father, an office in the Swiss army, might be able to help, lending them the country cottage he keeps for his retirement, but this is conditional on his son-in-law accepting the military stage under his command. Swiss military service can prove to be very trying for any participant, and this might put its toll on the relationships with the close ones.",
