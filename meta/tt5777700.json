  "overview": "Xavier Cugat was a musical genius, glitzy persona and the only Spaniard with two stars on Hollywood's Walk of Fame. Spanning continents and decades of musical and cinematic progression, this documentary reveals the incredible life of a Spanish legend. Through the direction of Diego Mas Trellis, this film helps us understand the role of Cugat as part of American history. A documentary that must be seen by any music-lover, it makes us realise that without Cugat, Latin music would be very different.",

Other stories are tied among these: a female teacher who is flirted by one of her students; a teenager's deception that joins again with her best friend from secondary school: the adventure of two porn actors who find love, and the amusing plans of a single man who just wishes to be kind with his old mother...\n\nFrom the producer and director of Todo el poder, and Cero y van cuatro, Fernando Sari\u00f1ana.",
