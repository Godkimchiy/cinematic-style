  "storyline": "The five daughters of a famous actor, all from different mothers and different nationalities, get together on the 10th anniversary of his death for a celebration of his career.",
  "plot": "Upon the tenth anniversary of the death of fictional film star Saverio Crispo, his four daughters get together in the family manor in Apulia, Southern Italy. As Saverio used to be at the top of his game as an internationally known film star, he had liaisons with different women across the world, thus having several love children. His children include his Italian daughter, Susanna, who is secretly engaged to Walter, the former editor of Saverio's latest movies, his French daughter, St\u00e9phanie, a mother of three sons from different men, his Spanish daughter, Segunda, the only one being married, and his youngest daughter, Solveig, from Sweden, who had little to no contact with her late father. None of the four women got to really know their late father, but each of them has fabricated an idealized and very personal memory of him.\n\nSaverio's two widows, the Italian-born Rita and the Spanish-born Ramona, are also present at the family reunion. The meeting happens as Saverio's hometown celebrates the late actor's life and achievements, but apparently many secrets are yet to be unveiled about his life and his family.",
