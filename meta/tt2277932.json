  "overview": "The world watches in awe as the Roebling Clipper is launched into space. Using state-of-the-art scalar engines to fly around the Moon and back in just hours, the maiden voyage of the first-ever trans-lunar passenger ship is about to make history. Among those on board: First Lady Simone Mathany, space-exploration entrepreneur Steve Roebling, Dr. Denise Balaban, pilot Fiona Henslaw, and a very lucky lottery winner. But while en route, a massive solar flare sparks a cosmic-ray burst that accelerates Aurora\u2019s engine and blows the ship away from Earth\u2019s orbit.  Now out of control, it\u2019s hurtling straight for the sun.",
  "storyline": "The world watches in awe as the Roebling Clipper is launched into space. Using state-of-the-art scalar engines to fly around the Moon and back in just hours, the maiden voyage of the first-ever trans-lunar passenger ship is about to make history. Among those on board: First Lady Simone Mathany, space-exploration entrepreneur Steve Roebling, Dr. Denise Balaban, pilot Fiona Henslaw, and a very lucky lottery winner. But while en route, a massive solar flare sparks a cosmic-ray burst that accelerates Aurora's engine and blows the ship away from Earth's orbit. Now out of control, it's hurtling straight for the sun. At Mission Control, along with the desperate President Thomas Mathany, an increasingly anxious team of experts puts a plan into motion - an interception by a shuttle attached to the International Space Station. When that ends in disaster, the Aurora only picks up speed. Now being pulled toward the sun at three percent of the speed of light, it's only a matter of hours before it ...",
  "plot": "A privately owned spaceship with passengers, among them the president's wife, is on its maiden flight around the Moon and back to Earth. When a massive solar storm blows the rocket off course, the ship moves forward out of control on a direct path toward the Sun, and eventually burns up. The quantum scalar drive powering the ship, which is engineered to withstand extreme temperatures, survives solar impact and puts the Sun into a hyperactive phase, causing massive bursts of radiation that have a devastating effect on Earth. The second half of the movie depicts these effects and peoples' struggles to find shelter and survive.\n\nIt is revealed that the US military has copied and militarized the quantum scalar drive, and built a spaceship powered by nuclear pulse propulsion to propel the weapon into orbit. The creator of the scalar drive teams up with a NASA astronaut to reconfigure the weapon so as to counteract the effects of the first one as it drops into the Sun. The Sun cools down and the Earth is saved from destruction.",
  "synopsis": "The worlds first commercial space shuttle is struck by a solar storm. The disaster hyper-charges the space shuttles engine and catapults the ship on a direct course for the sun. But the danger becomes cataclysmic when it's discovered that the event is triggering a much larger solar storm that could send Earth back into the Stone Age - if it isnt stopped in time."
