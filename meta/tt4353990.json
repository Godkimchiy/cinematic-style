  "overview": "Dez and Terri, a mixed-race couple married 20 years and adoptive parents, they are the trailblazing lesbians of the New South Africa. But, have these freedoms guaranteed them happiness?  Asanda, their 18 year old adopted daughter, is the poster child for South Africa\u2019s diversity but describes herself as \u201can experiment\u201d, being made up as she goes along. She meets Shado, an enigmatic Tommy Boy from Khayalitsha, a township on the edge of Cape Town, and a different picture of the New South Africa emerges.",
  "storyline": "WHILE YOU WEREN'T LOOKING is an original story, set in Cape Town. The protagonists are gay and lesbian, from all walks of life, whose intertwining tales present a humourous, inventive and dramatic take on contemporary life in South Africa. It is through the eyes and experiences of a cross-section of queers - black, white and coloured, cruisy singles, married couples with children, city and township dwellers, apartheid survivors and born frees, professionals and skollies - that we see the South African contemporary landscape unfold.",
