  "overview": "Katsuhito Ishii (\"Funky Forest: The First Contact\" and \"The Taste of Tea\") takes on the story of Junichi--a timid third grader who can't muster the courage to return an eraser he borrowed from his secret crush--and turns it into a children's rock 'n' roll comedy. Junichi's world is turned upside down as apprentice teacher Anna-sensei (Hikari Mitsushima) scraps her lesson plan to show the rambunctious students about life as an adult. With Anna's unorthodox style, Junichi and his friends are able to gain confidence and pursue their goal of putting on a big concert. Co-directed with Kanoko Kawaguchi and Atsushi Yoshioka, \"Hello! Junichi\" brings out the kid in adults and lets kids be kids. Boasting Ishii's signature dance numbers and Yoshiyuki Morishita (the \"Japanese Steve Buscemi\") as the band's homeroom teacher, it's a unique experience built for future and current movie maniacs.",
