  "overview": "At the NFL Draft, general manager Sonny Weaver has the opportunity to rebuild his team when he trades for the number one pick. He must decide what he's willing to sacrifice on a life-changing day for a few hundred young men with NFL dreams.",
  "storyline": "It's draft day in the NFL, and as General Manager of the Cleveland Browns, Sonny is forced to come up with a big move. After trading for the number one pick, Sonny has to choose between a lower-ranked linebacker with a questionable past, or a celebrated quarterback with a questionable future. All the while, Sonny is walking in the footsteps of his father, and personal complications force their way to the surface.",
  "plot": "On the morning of the 2014 NFL Draft in New York City, Chris Berman, Jon Gruden, Mel Kiper Jr., and other analysts discuss the consensus first overall pick: Wisconsin quarterback Bo Callahan, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner. Cleveland Browns general manager Sonny Weaver Jr., must decide how to use the seventh overall pick to improve his consistently losing team, but has other issues. He recently learned that his secret girlfriend Ali Parker, the team's salary cap analyst, is pregnant. His father, Sonny Weaver Sr., coached the Browns before Weaver Jr. fired him and died a week before the draft.\n\nWeaver's mother, Barb, is upset with him for missing the reading of Weaver Sr.'s will and for refusing to participate in distributing his father's ashes during draft day, and she doesn't approve of Weaver's girlfriend, Parker, either. Weaver reveals to Parker that he had fired his father as coach only because his mother asked him to on account of his father's failing health.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks hold the first overall pick, which general manager Tom Michaels offers to trade to the Browns. Weaver declines, but before leaving for the draft, team owner Anthony Molina \u2014 dissatisfied with current quarterback, Brian Drew, who had gone down with a knee injury in the fifth game of the previous season \u2014 strongly advises him to \"make a splash.\" Under that pressure from his owner, Weaver then reluctantly trades the Browns' first-round draft picks for that year and the next two years \u2014 considered an exorbitant price \u2014 for the Seahawks top pick. Many Seahawks fans wanted Callahan, however, and express their displeasure with picket signs at CenturyLink Field and on social media, demanding Michaels' firing.\n\nThe unexpected chance to obtain Callahan excites Browns fans. Most in the Browns' front office agree with the trade despite the high price; Drew and head coach Vince Penn \u2014 along with Weaver's mother \u2014 are exceptions. Penn agrees that Callahan is excellent but does not want to teach a rookie quarterback his system of offense. He much prefers to keep Drew at quarterback and wants Weaver to draft running back Ray Jennings of Florida State, whose father had starred for the Browns.\n\nDrew, who led the team to a 5\u20131 start the previous year before his injury, fears losing his job as the Browns' quarterback now that the Browns can pick Callahan. He trained hard in the off season recovering from his injury and greatly improving his leg strength and his throwing arm. Drew is so \"upset\" he trashes Weaver's office.\n\nThe Browns' trade for the number one pick leaks public after a tweet by linebacker Vontae Mack of Ohio State, who had been Weaver's preference for their now-gone seventh pick. Mack, whose good character is established through side-plot vignettes with his family, wants to play for the Browns, and now fears not being chosen until much later in the first round. He advises Weaver to rewatch the Ohio State vs. Wisconsin game in which Ohio State was defeated, but Mack sacked Callahan four times. Teams contact Weaver for possible transactions based on the trade; one from the Houston Texans implies that Mack will not remain available to the Browns in the second round.\n\nAfter rewatching some plays from Callahan's game against Mack, Weaver becomes concerned about Callahan's ability under pressure. Weaver also doubts Callahan's character when he learns from his security chief about a report that none of Callahan's teammates attended his big 21st birthday party, and that Callahan allegedly had lied to the Washington Redskins about reading the whole of that team's playbook. Callahan hadn't noticed the Redskins had taped a $100 bill to the last page of the playbook, and Weaver is told that, by way of contrast, Brian Drew's response to the $100-bill trick had been exemplary.\n\nWhen the draft begins that evening at Radio City Music Hall, the Browns have ten minutes to make the first overall pick. Distracted by his personal relationship with Parker and his mother Barb's untimely wish to spread his dad's ashes on the practice field that day, Weaver agonizes until the final minute over whom to select with his number-one pick. He abruptly chooses Mack, whom he wanted all along and whom he could have gotten with his original seventh pick, without giving up successive first-round draft choices. Roger Goodell's announcement of the selection amazes the league and the front office. While a relieved Drew believes that his job is safe, Molina becomes irate and flies back to Cleveland. Callahan has an anxiety attack, and storms out of the theater until his agent, Chris Crawford, persuades him to return and not show panic.\n\nPenn is incensed and threatens to quit as coach. Weaver's unexpected choice, however, disrupts the draft. Rumors spread about Callahan as other teams avoid him, fearing that the Browns know something they do not. It now appears the Seahawks still might be able to select Callahan with what had been the Browns' seventh pick.\n\nHowever, the Jacksonville Jaguars hold the sixth pick. The Jaguars' first two choices are no longer available, so their draft plans are in disarray, and their rookie general manager Jeff Carson is wary about Callahan because of the rumors. Weaver persuades the Jaguars to trade him their sixth pick for the next three years of the Browns' second-round draft picks.\n\nMolina arrives and angrily confronts Weaver, who asks the owner to wait five more minutes and let him do his job. Weaver then calls Michaels, who now wants Callahan, since he is under increasing pressure from Seahawk fans after trading away the number-one pick. Weaver demands all three of his former first-round draft picks back, plus the Seahawks' punt returner, David Putney, in exchange for the sixth pick. The Seahawks make the deal and choose Callahan with the sixth pick, thus getting him for about $7 million less than if the Seahawks had made him their first overall selection. Weaver then selects Jennings with his restored seventh pick, appeasing coach Penn and owner Molina.\n\nWeaver effectively has acquired Mack, Jennings and Putney expending only three years of second-round picks. This is universally acclaimed as an outstanding draft for the Browns. Additionally, in Drew the Browns have an experienced and fully healthy returning quarterback.\n\nWeaver and a visibly pregnant Parker attend the opening day of the 2014 season at FirstEnergy Stadium. Weaver laughs as he overhears retired Browns stars Jim Brown and Bernie Kosar congratulate Molina for doing \"a hell of a job\" with the draft and then hears Molina accept the credit.\n\nAfter the Brown's draft party, Weaver and Parker meet Weaver's mother, Barb, in a hallway, and the three reconcile over Weaver's excellent draft and Barb's upcoming first grandchild.\n\nThe team \u2014 including Mack, Jennings, Drew and Putney \u2014 explodes onto the field on opening day.",
  "synopsis": "DRAFT DAYWe open to Seattle, Washington. Seattle Seahawk HQ to be exact. The owner and Head coach Tom Michaels ( Patrick St. Esprit) are discussing what to do with their first round pick in the upcoming NFL Draft. The owner tells Tom to trade it for equal to what the Rams got for their first rounder in the 2012 draft. Tom says theres no team desperate enough to do that. He thinks about it and says hold on maybe.\nC\nue Cleveland, Ohio. We now see the GM of the Browns, Sonny Weaver JR ( Kevin Costner), putting on his tie and getting ready for the day. His Salary cap manager and girlfriend Ali (Jennifer Gardner) is in the shower behind him.\nSonny goes down stairs to the kitchen and pours him and Ali a cup of coffee. Sonny also slips a folded Post-it into his pocket. She comes down, and gives him the silent treatment. It comes out in conversation that she just told him she is pregnant and he didnt react in the way she would have liked. He blames it on what Today is.Sonny gets a phone call from a draft prospect, Vonte Mack (Chadwick Bowman, to remind him that Sonny must draft him at #7. If sonny doesnt, Vonte will tumble. And to quote Vonte My nephews like to tumble. I dont. Sonny reassures him not to worry.\nAfter the phone call is over, Sonny gets another phone call from Earl Jennings ( Terry Crews). He is an ex browns player and his son, Ray ( Arian Foster) is an Running Back in the draft and would like to play for the Browns also. Sonny reassures Ray to just have a great draft day. You only get oneSonny meets with the Browns owner, Anthony Molina ( Frank Langella) at a water park about what Sonny plans on doing with the pick. Molina tells Sonny to make a splash.\nAlmost like clockwork, the next person Sonny talks to is Tom. Tom offers him the #1 draft pick for the Browns next three first round picks. Sonny tells him hes crazy.\nNow we see the War room at Cleveland Browns HQ. The Head Coach, Coach Penn ( Denis Leary) with a few of the war room experts. Sonny comes in and tells them to throw away all that they were scouting on Vonte Mack. He now has the #1 pick and their going after the qb in the draft , Bo Callahan ( Josh Pence). He tells them what he gave up for the #1 pick. They tell him hes insane and that he ruined the franchise.Sonny goes to his office, to find that Ali has hired a new intern because the others are helping with the draft. He starts to yell at him. The pressure is getting to Sonny. Ali comes in and tries to talk to Sonny, he says he cant handle it. Ali leaves. Sonny gets a phone call from Bos Agent ( Sean Combs) and Bo himself. Sonny asks Bo a few questions, and Bo expresses his interest in playing for the Browns. Before he hangs up, Bos agent makes sure Bo gives Sonny his condolences because of Sonnys recent loss of his dad. Sonny says thanks and hangs up.\nThis is when Sonny gets a phone call from his mother, Barb (Ellen Burstyn).
