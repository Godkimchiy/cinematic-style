  "plot": null,
  "synopsis": "In order to cut costs, health company Welltrix chooses to automate their customer service operations thereby adding predictability but in the process eliminating customer service operators. Martin Starr plays Joe, the programmer who is creating the voice simulation software to do that. The main problem is that the script written by the software development team for the professional actresses lacks empathy. Luckily, Joe's wife Emily (Mae Whitman) is a concierge at a Chicago hotel (the Parkside) and her interaction with hotel customers is just what Welltrix is looking for. Martin asks her if she will record her voice for his 'answering machine/customer service person' and she agrees. She uses her customer service experience to 'humanize' the script and lends her voice to the new program. All works well until Joe becomes so enamored of his work that he gets more satisfaction interacting with his simulated wife than his real wife. Emily realizes this and the resulting conflict causes them to split-up. As they grow apart, Emily spends more time working at her passion: a type of improv theatre. Joe finally misses the real Emily, goes to the theatre where Emily performs and goes onstage to explain that he now realizes how he acted and misses her. The film ends with that question unresolved, will they get back together?"
