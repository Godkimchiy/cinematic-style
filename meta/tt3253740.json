  "storyline": "This is a tale of unique redemption, and an exploration of good and evil featuring a hitman and a Priest. On Christmas Eve, the hitman enters a church to confess his sins. Through a series of gripping flashbacks, the Confessor's journey is revealed.",
  "plot": "Junior high school teacher Yuko Moriguchi (Takako Matsu) announces to her class that she will resign before spring break. Moriguchi reveals that because the HIV-positive biological father of her daughter Manami was ill, she used to bring Manami (Mana Ashida) to school with her. One day, after school, she returned to the room where Manami was but found her gone. Her daughter was later found drowned in a school swimming pool. She then explains that two pupils in her class, whom she dubs \"Student A\" and \"Student B\", have murdered her four-year-old daughter.\n\nShe had found a small bunny purse amongst Manami's belongings which should not have belonged there, which led her to question Shuya Watanabe, one of her students. Shuya, who immediately admitted killing Manami, mocked her compassionate reaction to his feigned expression of remorse with \"just kidding\". She also questions Naoki Shimomura, who once saw Moriguchi refuse to buy Manami the small bunny purse at a store. She speaks with Naoki and his mother at his home, however his mother only feels bad for her own son and expresses no remorse for Moriguchi's daughter's death.\n\nHaving revealed their identities, she explained that because the killers, as minors, are protected by the Juvenile Law of 1947, turning them in wouldn't make a difference. So to exact revenge on them, she admits injecting her late daughter's biological father's HIV-contaminated blood in the milk cartons of the two students who she claimed to have murdered her daughter. The rest of the film switches between the aftermath of Moriguchi's confession and the events before the confession through a series of first-person narratives from Moriguchi and her three students.\n\nNaoki Shimomura (Kaoru Fujiwara), Student B, becomes a shut-in because he believes he has acquired AIDS from drinking HIV-contaminated milk. He tries to frantically disinfect everything he touches to make sure that his mom will not contract the disease. His mother (Yoshino Kimura), is unaware that he supposedly contracted AIDS and does not understand why Naoki has changed. She notices that Naoki become crazy whenever the new teacher, Mr. Terada (Masaki Oda), known by his students as Werther, visits to try and encourage Naoki to come back to school. After spotting the hidden malicious messages in well-wishes cards from Naoki's classmates, she realizes her son had more involvement in the incident than she previously assumed. Naoki admits to his mother that he intentionally murdered Manami, and that he knew she was alive before he threw her into the pool. Naoki's mother decides to commit murder-suicide to free her son and herself from torment, but in the ensuing struggle, Naoki kills her. The police arrest him for the murder.\n\nShuya Watanabe (Yukito Nishii), Student A, explains that his mother abused him before leaving to pursue her scientific ambitions. His father witnesses the abuse and divorces Shuya's mother. Shuya's mother abandons Shuya to continue with her scientific studies. Shuya confesses that her abandonment has driven him to thrive in science. He starts blogging his scientific discoveries on his personal website, however his website doesn't get any attention. He starts to record his execution machines and begins to document his killing and dissecting of animals, which begins to get much more attention. His first public invention, an electric anti-mugger wallet, earned him a science fair award, but it failed to make the headlines as the media was busy covering the \"Lunacy Incident\". His classmates decide to start bullying Shuya relentlessly as punishment for killing Manami.\n\nShuya and Naoki's recollections reveal that Shuya said he had upgraded the anti-mugger wallet. He decided to try it out on someone and roped Naoki in to help with his plan. They decided on Moriguchi's daughter Manami. However, when they tested it on Manami, Shuya's device only managed to render Manami unconscious. Shuya mistook this as instant death, who then told Naoki to tell the world that Shuya did it so that Shuya would become famous for the murder. At that time, Shuya also tells Naoki that he only used him, and never actually thought of them as friends. He proceeds to call Naoki useless before leaving. Enraged Naoki then threw the conscious Manami into the pool where she drowned, therefore proving he was the more effective killer.\n\nWerther eventually confronts the class about an \"anonymous note\" that he received from a student about how the class has been bullying Shuya. Werther is unaware that the students are bullying Shuya as punishment for murdering Manami. The classmates assume that Mizuki Kitahara (Ai Hashimoto) is the one who wrote the note, because she refuses to take part in the bullying. The classmates force classmate Mizuki to kiss Shuya as part of their bullying against Shuya. Shuya later shows Mizuki that he was not HIV-positive and Mizuki tells Shuya she believes Moriguchi had lied about the blood-contaminated milk as it was an implausible method of transmission. After spending time together, Mizuki eventually confesses to Shuya that she identified the \"Lunacy Murder\" girl, who poisoned her parents, as her other self. They soon become romantically involved. The bullying against Shuya and Mizuki ends when Shuya scares his classmates using his blood, which his classmates assume carry the disease.\n\nMizuki meets Moriguchi by chance at a restaurant. Moriguchi tells her about how she has been trying to get revenge on Shuya and how she is upset that the bullying against him has stopped. Moriguchi has been telling Werther to constantly visit Naoki. Werther was genuinely concerned about Naoki's well-being, however it turns out that Moriguchi was only using Werther to try and push Naoki over the edge. Mizuki confronts Moriguchi over the HIV-contaminated blood, to which Moriguchi admits that she never actually contaminated the blood, and only used that as a means to scare the two students and create stigma against them within the class which worked in Naoki's case but not Shuya's. Naoki had assumed that he contracted the disease but never actually got his blood tested for the disease. Mizuki proceeds to tell Moriguchi that Shuya only wants his mother's attention and that everything he has done was so his mother may come back to him.\n\nShuya is confused as to why Naoki would kill his mother who he loved so much. Mizuki and Shuya get into a confrontation over Shuya's Oedipus Complex which results in Shuya killing Mizuki, claiming that she was nothing but \"a means to relieve boredom\".\n\nAfter finally finding messages left with his mother's name and work place, Shuya visits the university where his mother works expecting to reunite with her, but discovers she has remarried. Believing she has forgotten him, he plants a bomb in his school's sport hall where the graduation ceremony is to be held and he is to give a speech, hoping that this will finally get his mother's attention. He records a video where he details his plans and leaves it on his website. However, to his surprise, the bomb does not go off during the ceremony. As he tries to work out what has happened, he receives a call from Moriguchi, who explains that she has been monitoring his website and relocated the bomb to his mother's office. When Shuya detonated the bomb, the bomb exploded in his mother's office instead of the school gymnasium, killing his mother in the process. She explains that it is her ultimate revenge, to let Shuya's mother die by his own hands, but his redemption would now begin. As the screen darkens, Moriguchi chuckles and says, \"just kidding.\"",
