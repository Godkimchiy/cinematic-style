  "overview": "A documentary exploring the importance of revival cinema and 35mm exhibition - seen through the lens of the patrons of the New Beverly Cinema - a unique and independent revival cinema in Los Angeles.",
  "storyline": "The New Bev is a theater where a double feature is still $8 - cash only. A theater where David Lynch pops by for a secret Q&A and where Edgar Wright introduces our monthly midnight screening of Scott Pilgrim whenever he is in town. A theater where directors program a week of their favorite films and come down to talk about how they inspired them. A theater where Fassbinder, Romero, Scorsese and Hitchcock films all show in the same week. Where you could catch a double feature of Citizen Kane and The Magnificent Ambersons - then stick around for the midnight screening of Cool As Ice. A place where the owner and employees genuinely care about cinema and are excited to talk to you about what the ending of Primer really means, or to recommend a film you've maybe never heard of. Since 1978 we've been home to dedicated film geeks, casual moviegoers and some of the greatest directors and actors in the world - everyone is treated equally here. We're one of the last places where that happens. ...",
  "plot": "This article needs an improved plot summary. (January 2016)\nThe story centers on Claire Bennett (Aniston) as she struggles to come to terms not only with the aftermath of the car accident that killed her son and left her partially disabled by chronic pain, but also with the suicide of Nina Collins (Kendrick), a woman from her chronic pain support group. The film documents how Claire's pain and grief affect her behavior, her relationships with other people, and her ability to function from just after Nina's death until she reaches a breakthrough point in her own path.",
