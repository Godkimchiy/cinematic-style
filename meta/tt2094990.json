Currently, he works for a Swiss investor group keen on taking over the French nation-wide meat production chain of Charcuteries Albert. If everything turns out well, Frank's bank will earn billions, and he'll be promoted to a director's post. He just needs the French side to agree to his plan, which is why he's on his way to Paris. While still at Airport Berlin-Tegel waiting to check in, Frank's progress is slowed to a standstill by chaotic author PATRIZIA MUNZ (beginning 30s), who wishes to board the plane under all circumstances, although the flight is overbooked in the economy class. Patrizia, an upcoming novelist, has forgotten her credit cards, when she received a phone call just an hour ago from a Paris clinic. Her lover, Parisian architect JEAN-JACQUES SECRETIN lies in a coma, heavily injured in a car crash. Frank, queuing nervously behind her, loans ...",

When she learns her allegedly unmarried boyfriend Jean-Jacques lies in a hospital in Paris because he had a grave car accident, she rushes head over heels to the airport. Unfortunately she forgets her credit card and cannot pay the ticket for Paris. By discussing this she causes a deadlock at the counter. A German business man (Frank) who has to stand line behind her fears he might miss his flight and helps her out with some money. So they get to know each other and get together to Paris, where Frank is supposed to handle an International merger. But both of them are confronted by unexpected twists when they arrive.
