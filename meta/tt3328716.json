  "overview": "The film tells the story of 11-year-old Dylan (Ed Oxenbould), who is brought up by his father (Sam Worthington) in a remote town in the country of Australia. Dylan\u2019s life is changed forever when he wins a place in the regional Paper Plane Championships in Sydney. The heart warming journey of a young boy and his father reconnecting after a family\u2019s struggle will have us cheering them all the way to the world championships of paper plane flying in Japan.",
  "storyline": "After an unexpected introduction to the world of competitive paper-plane throwing, the timid twelve-year-old, Dylan Weber, finally makes it to the Aussie Junior Championships in Sydney. However, with a resigned father living in the past, Dylan will have to use his resourcefulness to come up with a winning paper-plane model for the World Junior Paper Plane Championship in Tokyo, to compete against skilful and very ambitious contestants. Clearly, at the end of Dylan's great adventure, the only important thing is fighting for what matters in life--and even though winning is something--never giving up is everything.",
  "plot": "12 year old Dylan Webber lives in rural Western Australia. His mother died a few months ago and his father Jack, is unable to come to terms with the loss, has become depressed and withdrawn. Dylan brings food each day to a kite hawk named Clive which lives near his house, and he loves to watch it fly. A young student teacher visiting Dylan's school organizes a paper-plane contest, and Dylan, whose mother loved to make them, proves to have a natural talent, and he wins, making a plane that flies out of the school grounds. Dylan enters the state paper-plane championships, having to travel there by himself as Jack is too lethargic to get up early enough. Dylan wins a place in the National finals in Sydney. His father appears to takes little interest in his success, but Dylan receives more encouragement from his eccentric grandfather George a former wartime pilot.\n\nDylan and Jack drive to Sydney for the finals. Dylan becomes friends with Kimi Muroyama (Ena Imai), the visiting paper plane champion from Japan. His biggest rival is Jason Jones (Nicholas Bakopoulos-Cooke), the son of golf champion Patrick Jones (David Wenham). Dylan earns second-place in the finals, and is now eligible to compete in the world championship in Tokyo, but he has to pay his own air fare. Jack, who did not attend the event, but stayed in their motel room, still doesn't pay much attention to his son's exploits, and Dylan grows exasperated and angry with his dad.\n\nDylan has no money for the air fare, but Jack suddenly re-energizes. He organizes a garage sale, which is boosted by George and his nursing-home lady-friends, who bring home-made cakes to sell. A man offers to buy the piano which belonged to Dylan's mother, but Jack refuses, unable to part with it. The sale brings in enough cash for just one plane ticket, so Dylan has to travel by himself. Jack, becoming morose again, appears indifferent.\n\nIn Tokyo, Kimi teaches Dylan how to draw inspiration from nature when designing paper planes. Jason proves to be an ambitious and mean-spirited bully, even going as far as to push Dylan down a flight of stairs and sprain his wrist, but Dylan does his best to stand up to him and even to overcome his fear to needles. Dylan also becomes fixated on winning, but Jason's father Patrick, a kinder man than his son, reminds Dylan not to forget his family, and that Jack may simply need more time to recover. Dylan phones his dad, leaving a message on his answering machine, saying that he will stick by his father no matter what. Jack breaks down in tears as he listens.\n\nAt the finals, after Jason and Kimi both attain world record flights, Dylan is about to throw his conventional designed plane when he remembers Kimi's advice, and he thinks about Clive back home. At the last moment, he quickly re-designs his plane, modelling it after the kite hawk. He throws it and wins the championship and breaks the just-set world record, delighting the crowd and making even Jason join in the applause. The plane keeps flying back towards and then past Dylan, who turns around and sees the plane land in his father's hands. Dylan is overjoyed to see Jack, who has sold his wife's piano to buy a plane ticket to make it to the competition.",
