Within one week, she is suspended from school, stranded by her best friend, dumped by the boy she loved and inherits an enormous amount of money with the passing of her grandmother\u2013 only to be claimed under one condition: Maude must prove by age 18 that she knows exactly what to do with her life. But with her 18th birthday rapidly approaching, Maude must dive into a world of self-discovery or else lose the inheritance.",

Within one week just prior to her 18th birthday, she is suspended from school, stranded by her best friend, dumped by the boy she \"loves\", and Granny just died leaving her an enormous amount of money under one condition: Maude must go to college which she does not want to do and her wildly eccentric family is no help at all. Of course... It's a comedy!",
