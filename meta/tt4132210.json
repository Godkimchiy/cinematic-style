  "plot": "Squeaks and Bugs, as drawn in a promotional still.[a]\nIn Wabbit, the Looney Tunes return to their slapstick-comedy roots. Each episode contains two shorts, starring Bugs Bunny as the main character.\n\nOther Looney Tunes characters such as Wile E. Coyote and Yosemite Sam, show up to annoy him. Some characters are given new traits: Wile E. Coyote, for example, is Bugs' smart-aleck neighbor (akin to Wile E.'s previous outings with the rabbit), Yosemite Sam has a pudgy appearance and a larger mustache, and the Tasmanian Devil (renamed \"Theodore Tasmanian\") is employed as an accountant, though he represses his true self.\n\nAdded in are new characters who come to befriend Bugs, such as Squeaks the Squirrel and a childlike version of Bigfoot.\n\nLikewise, Bugs faces new villains, but not without the help of his friends. Bugs faces off against ninjas, barbarians, terminators, and a rabbit version of the Grim Reaper named Carl the Grim Rabbit.",
